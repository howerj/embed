\ ## A Meta-compiler, an implementation of eForth, and a tutorial on both.
\
\ ## Introduction
\
\ In this file a meta-compiler (or a cross compiler written in [Forth][]) is
\ described and implemented, and after that a working Forth interpreter
\ is both described and implemented. This new interpreter can be used in turn
\ to meta-compile the original program, ad infinitum. The design decisions
\ and the philosophy behind Forth and the system will also be elucidated.
\
\ This files source is a Forth program which the meta-compiler can read, it
\ is also used as source for a simple document generation system using [AWK][]
\ which feeds into either [Pandoc][] for [PDF][] or the original [Markdown][]
\ script for [HTML][] output. The AWK script is crude and requires that the
\ Forth source file, [embed.fth][] be formatted in a specific way.
\
\ Lines beginning with a back-slash are turned into normal Markdown text, with
\ some characters needed to be escaped. Other lines are assumed to be Forth
\ source code and are turned into Markdown code/literal-text blocks with
\ a number and '|' symbol preceding them, numbering starts from line '0001'.
\
\ ### What is Forth?
\
\ Forth is a stack based procedural language, which uses Reverse Polish
\ Notation (RPN) to enter expressions. It is a minimal language with no type
\ checking and little to no error handling depending on the implementation.
\ Despite its small size and simplicity it has various features usually found
\ in higher level languages, such as reflection, incremental compilation and
\ an interactive read-evaluate-print loop.
\
\ It is still at heart a language that is close to the machine with low
\ level capabilities and direct access to memory. Memory manage itself is
\ mostly manual, with preallocation of all needed memory the preferred method
\ of program writing.
\
\ Forth has mostly fallen out of favor in recent years, it performed admirably
\ on the microcomputer systems available in the 1980s and is still suitable
\ for very memory constrained embed systems (having on a few kilobytes of
\ memory available to them), but lacks a lot of features modern languages
\ provide.
\
\ A catalogue of deficiencies hamper Forth adoption; poor string handling,
\ lack of libraries and poor integration with the operating system (on hosted
\ platforms), mutually incompatible and wildly different Forth implementations
\ and as mentioned - little error detection and handling.
\
\ Despite this fact it has a core of adherents who find uses for the language,
\ in fact some of its deficiencies are actually trade-offs. Having no type
\ checking means there is no type checking to do, having very little in the way
\ of error detection means errors do not have to be detected. This off loads
\ the complexity of the problem to the programmer and means a Forth
\ implementation can be minimal and terse.
\
\ The saying "Once you have seen one Forth implementation, you have seen
\ one Forth implementation" comes about because of how easy it is to implement
\ a Forth, which is a double edged sword. It is possible to completely
\ understand a Forth system, the software, the hardware and the problems you
\ are trying to solve and optimize everything towards this goal. This is oft
\ not possible with modern systems, a single person cannot totally understand
\ even subcomponents of modern systems in its entirety (such as compilers
\ or the operating system kernels we use).
\
\ Another saying from the creator of Forth, Charles Moore,
\ "Forth is Sudoku for programmers". The reason the author uses Forth is
\ because it is fun, no more justification is needed.
\
\ ### Project Origins
\
\ This project derives from a simulator for a [CPU written in VHDL][], designed
\ to execute Forth primitives directly. The CPU and Forth interpreter
\ themselves have their own sources, which all makes for a confusing pedigree.
\ The CPU, called the H2, was derived from a well known Forth CPU written
\ in [Verilog][], called the [J1 CPU][], and the Forth running on the H2 comes
\ from an adaption of [eForth written for the J1][]  and
\ from 'The Zen of eForth' by C. H. Ting.
\
\ Instead of a metacompiler written in Forth a cross compiler for a Forth like
\ language was made, which could create an image readable by both the
\ simulator, and the FPGA development tools. The simulator was cut down and
\ modified for use on a computer, with new instructions for input and output.
\
\ This system, with a cross compiler and virtual machine written in C, was
\ used to develop the present system which consists of only the virtual
\ machine, a binary image containing a Forth interpreter, and this metacompiler
\ with the meta-compiled Forth. These changes and the discarding of the cross
\ compiler written in C can be seen in the Git repository this project comes
\ in (<https://github.com/howerj/embed>). The VM here is no longer compatible
\ with the [H2 CPU][] it was derived from.
\
\ The project, documentation and Forth images are under an [MIT license][].
\
\ ### The Virtual Machine
\
\ The virtual machine is incredibly simple and cut down at around 200 lines of
\ C code, with most of the code being not being the virtual machine itself,
\ but code to get data in and out of the system correctly, or setting the
\ machine up. It is described in the appendix (at the end of this file), which
\ also contains an example implementation of the virtual machine.
\
\ The virtual machine is 16-bit dual stack machine with an instruction set
\ encoding which allows for many Forth words to be implemented in a single
\ instruction. As the CPU is designed to execute Forth, Subroutine Threaded
\ Code (STC) is the most efficient method of running Forth upon it.
\
\ What you are reading is itself a Forth program, all the explanatory text is
\ are Forth comments. The file is fed through a preprocessor to turn it into
\ a [Markdown][] file for further processing.
\
\ Many Forths are written in an assembly language, especially the ones geared
\ towards microcontrollers, although it is more common for new Forth
\ interpreters to be written in C. A metacompiler is a [Cross Compiler][]
\  written in Forth.

\ The Virtual Machine is specifically designed to execute Forth, it is a stack
\ machine that allows many Forth words to be encoded in one instruction but
\ does not contain any high level Forth words, just words like *@*, 'r>' and
\ a few basic words for I/O. A full description of the virtual machine is
\ in the appendix.
\
\ ## Metacompilation wordset
\
\ This section defines the metacompilation wordset as well as the
\ assembler. The metacompiler, or cross compiler, requires some assembly
\ instructions to be defined so the two word sets are interlinked.
\
\ A clear understanding of how Forth vocabularies work is needed before
\ proceeding with the tutorial. Vocabularies are the way Forth manages
\ namespaces and are generally talked about that much, they are especially
\ useful (in fact pretty much required) for writing a metacompiler.

\ There are five types of instructions, which are differentiated from each
\ other by the top bits of the instruction.

a: #literal $8000 a; ( literal instruction - top bit set )
a: #alu     $6000 a; ( ALU instruction, further encoding below... )
a: #call    $4000 a; ( function call instruction )
a: #?branch $2000 a; ( branch if zero instruction )
a: #branch  $0000 a; ( unconditional branch )

\ An ALU instruction has a more complex encoding which can be seen in the table
\ in the appendix, it consists of a few flags for moving values to different
\ registers before and after the ALU operation to perform, an ALU operation,
\ and a return and variable stack increment/decrement.
\
\ Some of these operations are more complex than they first appear, either
\ because they do more than a single line explanation allows for, or because
\ they are not typical instructions that you would find in an actual processors
\ ALU and are only possible within the context of a virtual machine. Operations
\ like '#um/mod' are an example of the former, '#save' is an example of the
\ later.
\
\ The most succinct description of these operations, and the virtual machine,
\ is the source code for it which weighs in at under two hundred lines of
\ C code. Unfortunately this would not include that rationale that led to
\ the virtual machine being the way it is.

\ without one of these operations (generally) do not affect the stacks.

( a: r-2   $0008 or a; ( decrement variable stack by two, not used )

\ ### Peep hole Optimizer
\
\ The following words implement a primitive peephole optimizer, which is not
\ the only optimization done, but is the major one. It performs tail call
\ optimizations and merges the return instruction with the previous instruction
\ if possible. These simple optimizations really make a lot of difference
\ in the size of meta-compiled program. It means proper tail recursive
\ procedures can be constructed.
\
\ The optimizer is wrapped up in the *exit,* word, it checks a fence variable
\ first, then the previously compiled cell to see if it can replace the last
\ compiled cell.
\
\ The fence variable is an address below which the peephole optimizer should
\ not look, this is to prevent the optimizer looking at data and merging with
\ it, or breaking control structures.
\
\ An exit can be merged into an ALU instruction if it does not contain
\ any return stack manipulation, or information from the return stack. This
\ includes operations such as *r->pc*, or *r+1*.
\
\ A call then an exit can be replaced with an unconditional branch to the
\ call.
\
\ If no optimization can be performed an *exit* instruction is written into
\ the target.
\
\ The optimizer can be held off manually be inserting a *nop*, which is a call
\ or instruction which does nothing, before the *exit*.
\
\ Other optimizations performed by the metacompiler, but not this optimizer,
\ include; inlining constant values and addresses, allowing the creation of
\ headerless words which are named only in the metacompiler and not in the
\ target, and the 'fallthrough;' word which allows for greater code sharing.
\ Some of these optimizations have a manual element to them, such as
\ 'fallthrough;'.

\ ### Meta-Compiler Defining Words and Control Structures
\
\ *compile-only* and *immediate* set bits in the latest defined word for
\ making a word a "compile only" word (one which can only be executed from
\ within a word definition) and "immediate" respectively. None of these
\ are relevant to the execution of the metacompiler so are not checked by it,
\ but are needed when the target Forth is up and running.
\
\ These words affect the target dictionaries word definitions and not the
\ meta-compilers definitions.
\

: compile-only tlast @ tnfa t@ $20 or tlast @ tnfa t! ; ( -- )
: immediate    tlast @ tnfa t@ $40 or tlast @ tnfa t! ; ( -- )

\ *mcreate* creates a word in the metacompilers dictionary, not the targets.
\ For each word we create in the meta-compiled Forth we will need to create
\ at least one word in the meta-compilers dictionary which contains an address
\ of the Forth in the target.
\

: mcreate current @ >r target.1 current ! create r> current ! ;

\ *thead* compiles a word header into the target dictionary with a name
\ given a string. It is used by *t:*.
\

: thead ( b u -- : compile word header into target dictionary )
  header @ 0= if 2drop exit then
  talign
  there [last] t, tlast !
  there #target + pack$ c@ 1+ aligned tcp +! talign ;

\ *lookahead* parses the next word but leaves it in the input stream, pushing
\ a string to the parsed word. This is needed as we will be creating two
\ words with the same name with a word defined later on called *t:*, it
\ creates a word in the meta-compilers dictionary and compiles a word with
\ a header into the target dictionary.
\

: lookahead ( -- b u : parse a word, but leave it in the input stream )
  >in @ >r bl parse r> >in ! ;

\ The word *h:* creates a headerless word in the target dictionary for
\ space saving reasons and to declutter the target search order. Ideally
\ it would instead add the word to a different vocabulary, so it is still
\ accessible to the programmer, but there is already very little room on the
\ target.
\
\ *h:* does not actually affect the target dictionary, it can be used by
\ itself and is called by *t:*. *h:* is used in conjunction with either
\ *fallthrough;* or *t;* (*t;* calls *fallthrough;*). *h:* but does several
\ things:
\
\ 1. It sets *<literal>* to the meta-compilers version of *literal* so that
\ when we are compiling words within a meta-compiled word definition it does
\ the right thing, which is compile a number literal into the target
\ dictionary.
\ 2. It pushes a magic number *$F00D* onto the stack, this popped off and
\ checked for by *fallthrough;*, if it is not present we have messed up a
\ word definition some how.
\ 3. It creates a meta-compiler word in *target.1*, this word-list consists
\ of pointers into the target word definitions. The created word when called
\ compiles a pointer to the word it represents into the target image.
\ 4. It updates the *fence* variable to hold off the optimizer.
\
\ *fallthrough;* allows words to be created which instead of exiting just
\ carry on into the next word, which is a space saving measure and provides
\ a minor speed boost. Due to the way this Forth stores word headers
\ *fallthrough;* cannot be used to fall through to a word defined with a
\ word header.
\
\ *t;* does everything *fallthrough;* does except it also compiles an exit
\ into the dictionary, which is how a normal word definition is terminated.
\
\ The words *[* and *]* could be said to change the state of the meta-compiler,
\ even though the meta-compiler is not effected by the *state* variable. A
\ possible improvement to the meta-compiler and to the eForth image it
\ generates would be to vector words like *quit* so the [Outer Interpreter][]
\ could be replaced by the meta-compiler, or at least words like *interpret*
\ could be vectored. Another improvement would be to load and unload the
\ meta-compilers vocabularies when the new definitions of *:* and *;* are
\ encountered. There are man possibilities, however the improvements given
\ by them would be minor, using the meta-compiler is mostly like writing normal
\ Forth.

\ *fetch-xt* is used to check that a variable contains a valid execution token,
\ to implement certain functionality we will need to refer to functions yet
\ to be defined in the target dictionary. We will not be able to use these
\ features until we have defined these functions. For example we cannot use
\ *tconstant*, which defines a constant in the target dictionary, until we
\ have defined the target versions of *doConst*. A reference to this function
\ will be stored in *tdoConst* once it has been defined in the target
\ dictionary.

\ *tconstant* as mentioned defines a constant in the target dictionary which
\ is visible in that target dictionary (that is, it has a header and when
\ *words* is run in the target it will be in that list).
\
\ *tconstant* behaves like *constant* does, it parses out a name and pops
\ a variable off of the stack. As mentioned, it cannot be used until *tdoConst*
\ has been filled with a reference to the targets *doConst*. *tconstant* makes
\ a word in the meta-compiler which points to a word it makes in the target.
\ This words purpose when run in the target is to push a constant onto the
\ stack. When the constant is referenced when compiling words with the
\ meta-compiler it does not compile references to the constant, but instead
\ it finds out what the constant was and compiles it in as a literal - which
\ is a small optimization.

\ *tvariable* is like *tconstant* expect for variables. It requires *tdoVar*
\ is set to a reference to targets version of *doVar* which pushes a pointer
\ to the targets variable location when run in the target. It does a similar
\ optimization as *tconstant*, it does not actually compile a call to the
\ created variables *doVar* field but instead compiles the address as a literal
\ in the target when the word is called by the meta-compiler.

\ # The Target Forth
\ With the assembler and meta compiler complete, we can now make our target
\ application, a Forth interpreter which will be able to read in this file
\ and create new, possibly modified, images for the Forth virtual machine
\ to run.
\
\ ## The Image Header
\
\ The following *t,* sequence reserves space and partially populates the
\ image header with file format information, based upon the PNG specification.
\ See <http://www.fadden.com/tech/file-formats.html> and
\ <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/323604> for more information about
\ how to design binary formats.
\
\ The header contains enough information to identify the format, the
\ version of the format, and to detect corruption of data, as well as
\ having a few other nice properties - some having to do with how other
\ systems and programs may deal with the binary (such as have a string literal
\ *FTH* to help identify the binary format, and the first byte being outside
\ the ASCII range of characters so it is obvious that the file is meant to
\ be treated as a binary and not as text).

\ ## First Word Definitions
\ The very first definitions are for the first stage boot loader, which can
\ be used to manipulate the image before we do anything else
\

[t] <cold> 2/ 0  t!   ( set starting word )
[t] <cold> 2/ $E t!   ( set shadow register starting location )

\ After the header and boot-loader words, two short words are defined,
\ visible only to the meta compiler and used by its internal machinery. The
\ words are needed by *tvariable* and *tconstant*, and these constructs cannot
\ be used without them. This is an example of the metacompiler and the
\ meta-compiled program being intermingled, which should be kept to a minimum.

h: doVar   r> ;    ( -- a : push return address and exit to caller )
h: doConst r> @ ;  ( -- u : push value at return address and exit to caller )

\ Here the address of *doVar* and *doConst* in the target is stored in
\ variables accessible by the metacompiler, so *tconstant* and *tvariable* can
\ compile references to them in the target.

[t] doVar   tdoVar   meta!
[t] doConst tdoConst meta!

\ Next some space is reserved for variables which will have no name in the
\ target and are not on the target Forths search order. We do this with
\ *tlocation*. These variables are needed for the internal working of the
\ interpreter but the application programmer using the target Forth can make
\ do without them, so they do not have names within the target.
\
\ A short description of the variables and their uses:
\
\ *cp* is the dictionary pointer, which usually is only incremented in order
\ to reserve space in this dictionary. Words like *,* and *:* advance this
\ variable.
\
\ *root-voc*, *editor-voc*, *assembler-voc*, and *_forth-wordlist* are
\ variables which point to word lists, they can be used with *set-order*
\ and pointers to them may be returned by *get-order*. By default the only
\ vocabularies loaded are the root vocabulary (which contains only a few
\ vocabulary manipulation words) and the forth vocabulary are loaded (which
\ contains most of the words in a standard Forth).
\

\ None of these variables are set to any meaningful values here and will be
\ updated during the metacompilation process.
\

0 tlocation editor-voc        ( editor vocabulary )

\
\ ## Target Assembly Words
\
\ The first words added to the target Forths dictionary are all based on
\ assembly instructions. The definitions may seem like nonsense, how does the
\ definition of *+* work? It appears that the definition calls itself, which
\ obviously would not work. The answer is in the order new words are added
\ into the dictionary. In Forth, a word definition is not placed in the
\ search order until the definition of that word is complete, this allows
\ the previous definition of a word to be use within that definition, and
\ requires a separate word (*recurse*) to implement recursion.
\
\ However, the words *:* and *;* are not the normal Forth define and end
\ definitions words, they are the meta-compilers and they behave differently,
\ *:* is implemented with *t:* and *;* with *t;*.
\
\ *t:* uses *create* to make a new variable in the meta-compilers
\ dictionary that points to a word definition in the target, it also creates
\ the words header in the target (*h:* is the same, but without a header
\ being made in the target). The word is compilable into the target as soon
\ as it is defined, yet the definition of *+* is not recursive because the
\ meta-compilers search order, *meta*, is higher that the search order for
\ the words containing the meta-compiled target addresses, *target.1*, so the
\ assembly for *+* gets compiled into the definition of *+*.
\
\ Manipulation of the word search order is key in understanding how the
\ metacompiler works.
\
\ The following words will be part of the main search order, in
\ *forth-wordlist* and in the assembly search order.

\ ### Forth Implementation of Arithmetic Functions
\
\ As an aside, the basic arithmetic functions of Forth can be implemented
\ in terms of simple addition, some tests and bit manipulation, if they
\ are not available for your system. Division, the remainder operation and
\ multiplication are provided by the virtual machine in this case, but it
\ is interesting to see how these words are put together. The first task it
\ to implement an add with carry, or *um+*. Once this is available, *um/mod*
\ and *um\** are coded.
\
\       : um+ ( w w -- w carry )
\         over over + >r
\         r@ 0 < invert >r
\         over over and
\         0 < r> or >r
\         or 0 < r> and invert 1 +
\         r> swap ;
\
\       $F constant #highest
\       : um/mod ( ud u -- r q )
\         ?dup 0= if $A -throw exit then
\         2dup u<
\         if negate #highest
\           for >r dup um+ >r >r dup um+ r> + dup
\             r> r@ swap >r um+ r> or
\             if >r drop 1+ r> else drop then r>
\           next
\           drop swap exit
\         then drop 2drop [-1] dup ;
\
\       : m/mod ( d n -- r q ) \ floored division
\         dup 0< dup>r
\         if
\           negate >r dnegate r>
\         then
\         >r dup 0< if r@ + then r> um/mod r>
\         if swap negate swap exit then ;
\
\       : um* ( u u -- ud )
\         0 swap ( u1 0 u2 ) #highest
\         for dup um+ >r >r dup um+ r> + r>
\           if >r over um+ r> + then
\         next rot-drop ;
\
\ The other arithmetic operations follow from the previous definitions almost
\ trivially:
\
\       : /mod  over 0< swap m/mod ; ( n n -- r q )
\       : mod  /mod drop ;           ( n n -- r )
\       : /    /mod nip ;            ( n n -- q )
\       : *    um* drop ;            ( n n -- n )
\       : m* 2dup xor 0< >r abs swap abs um* r> if dnegate then ; ( n n -- d )
\       : */mod  >r m* r> m/mod ;    ( n n n -- r q )
\       : */  */mod nip ;            ( n n n -- q )
\
\
\ ### Inline Words
\
\ These words can also be implemented in a single instruction, yet their
\ definition is different for multiple reasons. These words should only be
\ use within a word definition begin defined within the running target Forth,
\ so they have a bit set in their header indicating as such.
\
\ Another difference is how these words are compiled into a word definition
\ in the target, which is due to the fact they manipulate the return stack.
\ These words are *inlined*, which means the instruction they contain is
\ written directly into a definition being defined in the running target
\ Forth instead of a call to a word that contains the assembly instruction,
\ calls obviously change the return stack, so these words would either have
\ to take that into account or the assembly instruction could be inlined,
\ the later option has been taken.
\
\ As these words are never actually called, as they are only of use in
\ compile mode, and then they are inlined instead of being called, we can
\ leave off *;* which would write an exit instruction on the end of the
\ definition.
\

\ The following execution vectors would/will be added if there is enough
\ space, it is very useful to have hooks into the system to change how
\ the interpreter behaviour works. Being able to change how the Forth
\ interpreter handles number parsing, for example, allows the processing of
\ double or floating point numbers in a system that could otherwise not
\ handle them.

\
\ ### Basic Word Set
\
\ The following section of words is purely a space saving measure, or
\ they allow for other optimizations which also save space. Examples
\ of this include *[-1]*; any number above $7FFF requires two instructions
\ to encode, numbers below only one, -1 is a commonly used number so this
\ allows us to save on space.
\
\ This does not explain the creation of a word to push the number zero
\ though, this only takes up one instruction.  This is instead explained
\ by the interaction of the peephole optimizer with function calls, calls
\ to functions can be turned into a branch if that instruction is
\ followed by an exit instruction. This is not true of literals. By defining 
\ '0' as a function This allows us to save space under special circumstances.
\
\ The following example illustrates this:
\
\	| FORTH CODE                   | PSEUDO ASSEMBLER         |
\	| ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
\	| : push-zero 0 literal ;      | LITERAL(0) EXIT          |
\	| : example-1 drop 0 literal ; | DROP LITERAL(0) EXIT     |
\	| : example-2 drop 0 literal ; | DROP BRANCH(push-zero)   |
\
\ Where *example-1* being unoptimized requires three instructions, whereas
\ *example-2* requires only two, with the two instruction overhead of
\ *push-zero*.
\
\ Optimizations like this explain some of the structure of the Forth
\ code, it is better to exit early and heavily factorize code if space is at
\ a premium, which it is due to the way the virtual machine works (both it
\ being 16-bit only, and only allowing the first 16KiB to be used for program
\ storage). Factoring code like this is similar to performing [LZW][]
\ compression, or similar dictionary related compression schemes.
\
\ Whilst factoring words into smaller, cleaner, definitions is highly
\ encouraged for Forth code (it is often an art coming up with the right
\ word name and associated concept it encapsulates), making words like
\ *2drop-0* is not. It hurts readability as there is no reason or idea backing
\ a word like *2drop-0*, even if it is fairly clear what it does from its
\ name. This is only done as a space saving measure.
\
h: [-1] -1 ;                 ( -- -1 : space saving measure, push -1 )
h: 0x8000 $8000 ;            ( -- $8000 : space saving measure, push $8000 )

\ This group of words implement some of the basic words expected in Forth; 
\ simple stack manipulation, tests, and other one, or two line definitions 
\ that do not really require an explanation of how they work - only why they 
\ are useful. Some of the words are described by their stack comment entirely, 
\ like *2drop*, other like *cell+* require a reason for such a simple word 
\ (they embody a concept or they help hide implementation details).

\ *execute* requires an understanding of the return stack, much like
\ *doConst* and *doVar*, when given an execution token of a word, a pointer
\ to its Code Field Address (or CFA), *execute* will call that word. This
\ allows us to call arbitrary functions and change, or vector, execution at
\ run time. All *execute* needs to do is push the address onto the return
\ stack and when *execute* exits it will jump to the desired word, the callers
\ address is still on the return stack, so when the called word exit it will
\ jump back to *executes* caller.
\
\ *@execute* is similar but it only executes the token if it is non-zero.
\

: execute >r ;                   ( cfa -- : execute a function )
h: @execute @ ?dup if execute exit then ;  ( cfa -- )
\
\ As the virtual machine is only addressable by cells, and not by characters,
\ the words *c@* and *c!* cannot be defined as simple assembly primitives,
\ they must be defined in terms of *@* and *!*. It is not difficult to do,
\ but does mean these two primitives are slower than might be first thought.
\

: c@ dup@ swap first-bit 3 lshift rshift h: lsb $FF and ;; ( b--c: char load )

  tuck first-bit 3 lshift dup>r swap lsb swap
  lshift over @
  $FF r> 8 xor lshift and or swap! ;

\ *here*, *align*, *cp!* and *allow* all manipulate the dictionary pointer,
\ which is a common operation. *align* aligns the pointer up to the next
\ cell boundary, and *cp!* sets the dictionary pointer to a value whilst
\ enforcing that the value written is aligned.
\
\ *here* retrieves the current dictionary pointer, which is needed for
\ compiling control structures into words, so is used by words like *if*,
\ and has other uses as well.
\

: here cp @ ;                         ( -- a )
: align here fallthrough;             ( -- )
h: cp! aligned cp ! ;                 ( n -- )

\ *allot* is used in Forth to allocate memory after using *create* to make
\ a new word. It reserves space in the dictionary, space can be deallocated
\ by giving it a negative number, however this may trash whatever data is
\ written there and should not generally be done.
\
\ Typical usage:
\
\	create x $20 allot ( Create an array of 32 values )
\	$cafe  x $10 !     ( Store '$cafe' at element 16 in array )
\

: allot cp +! ;                        ( n -- )

\ *2>r* and *2r>* are like *rot* and *-rot*, useful but they should not
\ be overused. The words move two values to and from the return stack. Care
\ should exercised when using them as the return stack can easily be corrupted,
\ leading to unpredictable behavior, much like all the return stack words.
\ The optimizer might also change a call to one of these words into a jump,
\ which should be avoided as it could cause problems in edge cases, so do not
\ use these words directly before an *exit* or *;*.
\

h: 2>r rxchg swap >r >r ;              ( u1 u2 --, R: -- u1 u2 )
h: 2r> r> r> swap rxchg nop ;          ( -- u1 u2, R: u1 u2 -- )

\ *doNext* needs to be defined before we can use *for...next* loops, the
\ metacompiler compiles a reference to this word when *next* is encountered.
\
\ It is worth explaining how this word works, it is a complex word that
\ requires an understanding of how the return stack words, as well as how
\ both *for* and *next* work.
\
\ The *for...next* loop accepts a value, *u* and runs for *u+1* times.
\ *for* puts the loop counter onto the return stack, meaning the
\ loop counter value is available to us as the first stack element, but
\ also meaning if we want to exit from within a *for...next* loop we must
\ pop off the value from the return stack first.
\
\ The *next* word compiles a *doNext* into the dictionary, and then the
\ address to jump back to, just after the *for* has compiled a *>r* into the
\ dictionary.
\
\ *doNext* has two possible actions, it either takes the branch back to
\ the place after *for* if the loop counter non zero, being careful to
\ decrement the loop counter and restoring it the correct place, or
\ it jumps over the place where the back jump address is stored in the
\ case when the loop counter is zero, removing the loop counter from the
\ return stack.
\
\ This is all possible, because when *doNext* is called (and it must be
\ called, not jumped to), the return address points to the cell after
\ *doNext* is compiled into. By manipulating the return stack correctly it
\ can change the program flow to either jump over the next cell, or jump
\ to the address contained in the next cell. Understanding the simpler
\ *doConst* and *doVar* helps in understanding this word.

\ *min* and *max* are standard operations in many languages, they operate
\ on signed values. Note how they are factored to use the *mux* word, with
\ *min* falling through into it, and *max* calling *mux*, all to save on space.
\
\ A more useful version of 'mux' operates using bitwise logic only, computing
\ the operation '(~mask & x1) | (mask & x2)', with the word stack comment
\ being '( x1 x2 mask -- x )'. However, it is slightly longer.

\ *key* retrieves a single character of input, it is a vectored word so the
\ method used to get data can be changed.
\
\ It calls *bye* if the End of File character is returned (-1, which is
\ outside the normal byte range). It also calls *yield?* directly, instead
\ of through *bye*, with a value to indicate that the virtual machine should
\ yield to the process that called the virtual machine, in C, so it can do
\ other work as there is no input available at the moment, and it loops until
\ there is some input. All of this is transparent to the user of *key*.
\
\ *bye* exits the interpreter in the standard fashion, however the C program
\ calling the virtual machine is free to run the same image again which will
\ start off executing at the yield again (which will not yield the second
\ time as it sets its second parameter to zero the first time) if a call
\ to reset the virtual machine is not made. The C program may repeatedly do
\ this, send the virtual machine input that runs out when it wants to evaluate
\ strings of Forth programs.

\ */string*, *+string* and *count* are for manipulating strings, *count*

\ advance the pair beyond the end of the string.

   swap 0 max for aft dup emit then next drop ;
h: colon-space [char] : emit space ;   ( -- )

\ *depth* and *pick* require knowledge of how this Forth implements its
\ stacks. *sp0* contains the location of the stack pointer when there is
\ nothing on the stack, and *sp@* contains the current position. Using this
\ it is possible to work out how many items, or how deep it is. *pick* is
\ used to pick an item at an arbitrary depth from the return stack. This
\ version of *pick* does this by indexing into the correct position and using
\ a memory load operation to do this.
\
\ In some systems Forth is implemented on this is not possible to do, for
\ example some Forths running on CPUs specifically designed to run Forth
\ have stacks made in hardware which are not memory mapped. This is not just
\ a hypothetical, the H2 Forth CPU (based on the J1 CPU) available at
\ <https://github.com/howerj/forth-cpu> has stacks whose only operations are
\ to increment and decrement them by a small number, and to get the current
\ stack depth. On a platform like this, *pick* can still be implemented,
\ but it is more complex and can be done like this:
\
\	: pick ?dup if swap >r 1- pick r> swap exit then dup ;
\

h: vrelative sp@ swap - ;  ( u -- u : position relative to sp )
: depth sp0 vrelative cell- chars ; ( -- u : get current depth )
: pick cells vrelative @ ;          ( vn...v0 u -- vn...v0 vu )

\ *ndrop* removes a variable number of items off the variable stack, which
\ is sometimes needed for cleaning things up before exiting a word.
\

h: ndrop cells vrelative sp! drop ; ( 0u...nu n -- : drop n cells )

\ *>char* takes a character and converts it to an underscore if it is not
\ printable, which is useful for printing out arbitrary sections of memory
\ which may contain spaces, tabs, or non-printable. *list* and *dump* use
\ this word. *typist* can either use *>char* to print out a memory range
\ or it can print out the value regardless if it is printable.
\

h: >char dup $7F =bl within if drop [char] _ then ; ( c -- c )
: type 0 fallthrough;                  ( b u -- )
h: typist                              ( b u f -- : print a string )
  >r begin dup while
    swap count r@
    if
      >char
    then
    emit
    swap 1-
  repeat
  rdrop 2drop ;
h: print count type ;                    ( b -- )
h: $type [-1] typist ;                   ( b u --  )

\ *cmove* and *fill* are generic memory related functions for moving blocks
\ of memory around and setting blocks of memory to a specific value
\ respectively.

: cmove for aft >r dup c@ r@ c! 1+ r> 1+ then next 2drop ; ( b b u -- )
: fill  swap for swap aft 2dup c! 1+ then next 2drop ;     ( b u c -- )

\
\ ### Exception Handling
\
\ *catch* and *throw* are complex and very useful words, these words are
\ minor modifications to the ones provided in the [ANS Forth standard][].
\
\ The standard describes the stack effects of *catch* and *throw* as so:
\
\	catch ( i*x xt -- j*x 0 | i*x n )
\	throw ( k*x n -- k*x | i*x n )
\
\ Which is a difficult stack effect to digest, although their use is quite
\ simple.
\
\ *catch* accepts an execution token, which it executes, if throw is somehow
\ invoked when the execution token is run, then *catch* catches the exception
\ and returns the exception number thrown. If no exception was thrown then
\ *catch* returns zero.
\
\ *throw* is used to throw exceptions, it can be used anyway to indicate
\ something has gone wrong, or to affect the control throw of a program in
\ a portable way (instead of messing around with the return stack using *>r*
\ and *r>*, which is non-portable), although it is ill advised to use
\ exceptions for control flow purposes. *throw* only throws an exception if
\ the value provided to it was non-zero, otherwise execution continues as
\ normal.
\
\ Example usage:
\
\	: word-the-might-fail 2 2 + 5 = if -9001 throw then ;
\	: foo
\	   ' word-the-might-fail catch
\	   ?dup if abort" Something has gone terribly wrong..." then
\	   ." Everything went peachy" cr ;
\

: catch ( i*x xt -- j*x 0 | i*x n )
  sp@       >r
  handler @ >r
  rp@ handler !
  execute
  r> handler !
  r> drop-0 ;

: throw ( k*x n -- k*x | i*x n )
  ?dup if
    handler @ rp!
    r> handler !
    rxchg ( *rxchg* is equivalent to 'r> swap >r' )
    sp! drop r>
  then ;

\ Negative numbers take up two cells in a word definition when compiled into
\ one, whilst positive words only take up one cell, as a space saving
\ measure we define *-throw*. Which negates a number before calling *throw*.
\
\ We then do something curious, we set the second cell in the target virtual
\ machine image to a branch to *-throw*. This is because it is the
\ the virtual machine sets the program counter to the second cell (at address
\ $2, or 1 cell in) whenever an exception is raised when executing an
\ instruction, such as a division by zero. By setting the cell to the
\ execution token divided by two we are setting that cell to an unconditional
\ branch to *-throw*. The virtual machine also puts a number indicating what
\ the exception was on the top of the stack so it is possible to determine
\ what went wrong.
\

h: -throw negate throw ;  ( u -- : negate and throw )
[t] -throw 2/ 4 tcells t!

\ *?depth* throws an exception if a certain number of items on the stack
\ do not exist. It is possible to use this primitive to implement some basic
\ checks to make sure that words are passed the correct number of arguments.
\
\ By using *?depth* strategically it is possible to catch errors quite
\ quickly with minimal overhead in speed and size by selecting only a few
\ words to put depth checking in.

h: 1depth 1 fallthrough; ( ??? -- : check depth is at least one )
h: ?depth depth < ?exit 4 -throw ; ( ??? n -- check depth )

\
\ ## Numeric Output
\
\ With the basic word set in place and exception handling, as well as some
\ variables being defined, it is possible to define the numeric output wordset,
\ this word set will allow numbers to be printed or strings to the numeric
\ representation of a number defined.
\
\ Numeric output in Forth, as well as input, is controlled by the *base*
\ variable, it is possible to enter numbers and print them out in binary,
\ octal, decimal, hexadecimal or any base from base 2 to base 36 inclusive.
\ This section only deals with numeric output. The numeric output string
\ is formed within a temporary buffer which can either be printed out or
\ copied to another location as needed, the method for doing this is known
\ as Pictured Numeric Output. The words *<#*, *#*, *#>* and *hold* form the
\ kernel from which the other numeric output words are formed.
\
\ As a note, [Base-36][] can be used as a fairly compact textual encoding of
\ binary data if needed, like [Base-64][] encoding but without the need for a
\ special encoding and decoding scheme.
\
\ First, a few utility words are formed, *decimal* and *hex* set the base
\ to known values. These are needed so the programmer can get the interpret
\ back to a known state when they have set the radix to a value (remember,
\ *10* is valid and different value in every base!), as well as a quick
\ shorthand.
\
\ The word *radix* is then defined, which is used to check that the *base*
\ variable is set to a meaningful value before it is used, between 2 and 36,
\ inclusive as previously mentioned. Radixes or bases higher than 10 uses the
\ alphabet after 0-9 to represent higher numbers, so *a* corresponds to *10*,
\ there are only 36 alphanumeric characters (ignoring character case) meaning
\ higher numbers cannot be represented. If the radix is outside of this range,
\ then base is set back to its default, decimal, and an exception is thrown.
\

: decimal  $A fallthrough;  ( -- : set base to decimal )
h: base! base ! ;           ( u -- : set base )
: hex     $10 base! ;                      ( -- )
h: radix base@ dup 2 - $23 u< ?exit decimal $28 -throw ; ( -- u )

\ *digit* converts a number to its character representation, but it only
\ deals with numbers less than 36, it does no checking for the output base,
\ but is a straight forward conversion utility. It assumes that the [ASCII][]
\ character set is being used.
\
\ *extract* is used to divide the number being converted by the current
\ output radix, extracting a single digit which can be passed to *digit*
\ for conversion.
\
\ *hold* then takes this extracted and converted digit and places in the
\ hold space, this is where the string representing the number to be output
\ is held. It adds characters in reverse order to the hold space, which is
\ due to how *extract* works, *extract* gets the lowest digit first.
\
\ Lets look at how conversion would work for the number 1234 in base 10. We
\ start of the number to convert and extract the first digit:
\
\	1234 / 10 = 123, remainder 4 (hold ASCII 4)
\
\ We then add *4* to the hold space, which is the last digit that needs to
\ be output, hence storage in reverse order. We then continue on with the
\ output conversion:
\
\	123 / 10  = 12,  remainder 3 (hold ASCII 3)
\	12  / 10  = 1,   remainder 2 (hold ASCII 2)
\	1   / 10  = 0,   remainder 1 (hold ASCII 1)
\	0 <- conversion complete!
\
\ If we did not store the string in reverse order, we would end up printing
\ *4321*.
\
\ The words *<#*, *#*, and *#>* call these words to do the work of numeric
\ conversion, but before this is described,  Notice the checking that is done
\ within each of these words, *hold* makes sure that too many characters are
\ not stored in the hold space. *#* checks the depth of the stack before it
\ is called and the base variable is only accessed with the *radix* word.
\ This combination of checking catches most errors that occur and makes sure
\ they do not propagate.

: hold   hld @ 1- dup hld ! c! fallthrough;     ( c -- )
h: ?hold hld @ pad $80 - u> ?exit $11 -throw ; ( -- )
h: extract dup>r um/mod rxchg um/mod r> rot ;  ( ud ud -- ud u )
h: digit 9 over < 7 and + [char] 0 + ;         ( u -- c )

\ The quartet formed by "<# # #s #>" look intimidating to the new comer, but
\ is quite simple. They allow the format of numeric output to be controlled
\ quite easily by the programmer. A description of these words:
\
\ - *<#* resets the hold space and initializes the conversion.
\ - *#*  extracts, converts and holds a single character.
\ - *#s* repeatedly calls *#* until the number has been fully converted.
\ - *#>* finalizes the conversion and pushes a string.
\
\ Anywhere within this conversion arbitrary characters can be added to
\ the hold space with *hold*. These words should always be used together,
\ whenever you see *<#*, you should see an enclosing *#>*. Once the *#>* has
\ been called the number provided has been fully converted to a number string
\ in the current output base, and can be printed or copied.
\
\ These words will go on to form more convenient words for numeric output,
\ like *.*, or *u.r*.
\

: #> 2drop hld @ pad over- ;                ( w -- b u )
: #  2 ?depth 0 base@ extract digit hold ;  ( d -- d )
: #s begin # 2dup d0= until ;               ( d -- 0 )
: <# pad hld ! ;                            ( -- )

\ *sign* is used with the Pictured Numeric Output words to add a sign character
\ if the number is negative, *(.)* is then defined to convert a number in any
\ base to its signed representation (regardless of the current base).
\

: sign 0< 0= ?exit [char] - hold ; ( n -- )
h: (.) ( n -- b u : convert a signed integer to a numeric string )
  dup>r abs 0 <# #s r> sign #> ;

\ *.r*, *u.r* are used as the basis of further words with a more controlled
\ output format. They implement right justification of a number (signed for
\ *.r*, unsigned for *u.r*) by the number of spaces specified by the first
\ argument provided to them. This is useful for printing out columns of
\ data that is for human consumption.
\
\ *u.* prints out an unsigned number with a trailing space, and *.* prints out
\ a signed number when operating in decimal, and an unsigned one otherwise,
\ again with a trailing space. Neither adds leading spaces.
\

h: (u.) 0 <# #s #> ;             ( u -- b u : turn *u* into number string )
: u.r >r (u.) r> fallthrough;    ( u +n -- : print u right justified by +n)
h: adjust over- spaces type ;    ( b n n -- )
h: d5u.r dup fallthrough;        ( u -- u )
h: 5u.r space 5 u.r ;            ( u -- )
( :  .r >r (.)( r> adjust ;      ( n n -- : print n, right justified by +n )
: u.  (u.) h: blt space type ;;  ( u -- : print unsigned number )
:  .  (.) blt ;                  ( n -- print number )
( : >base swap base @ >r base ! execute r> base ! ; )
( : d. $a  '  . >base ; )
( : h. $10 ' u. >base ; )

\ *holds* and *.base* can be defined as so:
\
\        : holds begin dup while 1- 2dup + c@ hold repeat 2drop ;
\        : .base base@ dup decimal base! ; ( -- )
\
\ If needed. *?* is another common utility for printing out the contents at an
\ address:
\
\        : ? @ . ; ( a -- : display the contents in a memory cell )
\

\
\ ### String Handling and Input
\
\ *pack$* and *=string* are more advanced string handling words for copying
\ strings to a new location, turning it into a counted string, which *pack$*
\ does, or for comparing two string, which *=string* does.
\
\ *expect*, *query* and *accept* are used for fetching a line of input which
\ can be further processed. Input in Forth is fundamentally line based, a
\ line is fetch from the terminal, which is then parsed into tokens delimited
\ by whitespace called words, which are then processed by the Forth
\ interpreter. On hosted systems the input typed into a terminal is usually
\ line buffered, you type in a line and hit return, then the line is passed
\ to the program reading from the terminal. This is not the case on all
\ systems, often it is the case that the Forth will be on a different target
\ and the programmer is talking to it via a serial port, the programmer sends
\ a character - not an entire line - and the Forth interpreter echos back a
\ character, or not. This means that the Forth interpreter has to mimic the
\ line handling normally provided by the terminal emulator. As this is a hosted
\ Forth it does not have to do this, however the capability to handle input
\ in this way is left commented out so the system is easier to port across
\ to such platforms. Either way, a line of text needs to be fetched from an
\ input stream.
\
\ First to describe *pack$* and *=string*.
\
\ *pack$* takes a string, its length, and a place which is assumed to be
\ large enough to store the string in as a final argument. Creates a counted
\ string and places it in the target location, this word is especially useful
\ for the creation of word headers which will be needed later.
\
\ *=string* checks for string equality, as it has the length of both strings
\ it checks their lengths first before proceeding to check all of the string,
\ this saves a little time. Only a yes/no to the comparison is returned as
\ a boolean answer, unlike [strcmp][] in C.
\
\ *down* aligns a cell down to the next aligned address.
\

h: down cell negate and ; ( a -- a : align down )

xchange _forth-wordlist _system
: pack$ ( b u a -- a ) \ null fill
  aligned dup>r over
  dup down
  - over+ zero 2dup c! 1+ swap ( 2dup 0 fill ) cmove r> ;
xchange _system _forth-wordlist

: compare ( a1 u1 a2 u2 -- n : string equality )
  rot
  over- ?dup if >r 2drop r> nip exit then
  for ( a1 a2 )
    aft
      count rot count rot - ?dup
      if rdrop nip nip exit then
    then
  next 2drop-0 ;

\ *^h* and *ktap* are commented out as they are not needed, they deal with
\ line based input, some sections of *tap* and *accept* are commented out
\ as well as they are not needed on a hosted system, thus the job of *accept*
\ is simplified. It is still worth talking about what these words do however,
\ in case they need to be added back in.
\
\ *accept* is the word that does all of the work and calls *^h* and *ktap* when
\ needed, *query* and *expect* a wrappers around it. Image we are talking to
\ the Forth interpreter over a serial line, if the programmer sends a character
\ to the Forth interpreter it is up to the Forth interpreter how to respond,
\ the remote interpreter needs to echo back characters to the programmer
\ otherwise they will be greeted with a blank terminal. Likewise the remote
\ Forth interpreter needs to process not only new lines, indicating a new
\ line of input should be accepted for processing, but it also needs to deal
\ with backspace characters, which are used to delete characters in the current
\ input line. It also needs to make sure it does not overflow the input buffer,
\ or when deleting characters go beyond the beginning of the input buffer.
\
\ *accept* takes an address of an input buffer and a length of it, the words
\ *^h*, *tap* and *ktap* are free to move around inside that buffer and do
\ so based on the latest character received.
\
\ *^h* takes a pointer to the bottom of the input buffer, one to the end of
\ the input buffer and the current position. It decrements the current position
\ within the buffer and uses *echo* - not *emit* - to output a backspace to
\ move the terminal cursor back one place, a space to erase the character and
\ a backspace to move the cursor back one space again. It only does this if it
\ will not go below the bottom of the input buffer.
\

\ h: ^h ( bot eot cur -- bot eot cur )
\  >r over r> swap over xor
\  if =bs echo =bl echo =bs echo then ;

h: ^h ( bot eot cur -- bot eot cur )
  >r over r@ < dup
  if
    =bs dup echo =bl echo echo
  then r> + ;

\ *tap* is used to store a character in the current line, *ktap* can also
\ call this word, *tap* uses echo to echo back the character - it is currently
\ commented out as this is handled by the terminal emulator but would be
\ needed for serial communication.

h: tap dup echo over c! 1+ ; ( bot eot cur c -- bot eot cur )

\
\ *ktap* processes the current character received, and has the same buffer
\ information that *^h* does, in fact it passes that information to *^h* to
\ process if the character is a backspace. It also handles the case where a
\ line feed, indicating a new line, has been entered. It returns a modified
\ buffer.

h: delete? dup =bs = swap =del = or 0= ; ( c -- t : delete key pressed? )
h: ktap                                  ( bot eot cur c -- bot eot cur )
 dup =cr xor
 if delete? \ =bs xor
   if =bl tap exit then ^h exit
 then fallthrough;
h: drop-nip-dup drop nip dup ;

\ *accept* takes an buffer input buffer and returns a pointer and line length
\ once a line of text has been fully entered. A line is considered fully
\ entered when either a new line is received or the maximum number of input
\ characters in a line is received, *accept* checks for both of these
\ conditions. It calls *tap* to do the work. In an alternate version it calls
\ the execution vector *<tap>*, which is usually set to *ktap*, which is shown
\ as a commented out line.
\

h: ktap? dup =bl - 95 u< swap =del <> and ; ( c -- t : possible ktap? )
h: raw? cpu@ 2 and 0<> ; ( c -- t : raw terminal mode? )
: accept ( b u -- b u )
  over+ over
  begin
    2dupxor
  while
    \ we need to be wary of 'key', because it calls 'bye' when input
    \ is exhausted it is an exit and potential entry point into the program,
    \ so we should try to keep the stack elements from 'accept' hidden
    >r 2>r key 2r> rot r> swap dup
    raw? if ( we need to handle echoing, and handling delete keys )
      \ =bl - 95 u< if tap else <tap> @execute then
      ktap? if tap else <tap> @execute then
    else ( the terminal takes care of it )
      =lf xor if tap else drop-nip-dup then
    then
  repeat drop over- ;

\ *<expect>* is set to *accept* later on in this file, but can be changed if
\ needed. *expect* and *query* both call *accept* this way. *query* uses the
\ systems input buffer and stores the result in a know location so that the
\ rest of the interpreter can use the results. *expect* gets a buffer from the
\ user and stores the length of the resulting string in *span*.
\

: expect <expect> @execute span ! drop ;   ( b u -- )
: query tib tib-length <expect> @execute #tib ! drop-0 fallthrough;
h: in! >in ! ;                             ( u -- )

\ *query* stores its results in the Terminal Input Buffer (TIB), which is way
\ the word *tib* gets its name. The TIB is a simple data structure which
\ contains a pointer to the buffer itself and the length of the most current
\ input line.
\
\ Now we have a line based input system, and from the previous chapters we
\ also have numeric output, the Forth interpreter is starting to take shape.
\
\ ## Dictionary Words
\
\ These words either navigate around the word header, or search through the
\ dictionary to find a word, both word sets are related. This section now
\ requires an understanding on how this Forth lays out its word headers, each
\ Forth tends to do this in a slightly different way and more modern Forths
\ use more advanced (and more complex, perhaps un-forth-like) techniques.
\
\ The dictionary is organized into word lists, and these words lists are simply
\ linked lists of all the words in that list. To find a definition by name
\ we search through all of the word lists in the current search order following
\ the linked lists until they terminate.
\
\ This Forth, like [Jones Forth][] (another literate Forth designed to teach
\ how a Forth interpreter works), lays out its dictionary in a way that is
\ simpler than having a separate storage area for word names, but complicates
\ other parts of the system. Most other Forths have a separate space for
\ string storage where names of words and pointers to their code field are
\ kept. This is how things were done in the original eForth model.
\
\ A word list looks like this..
\
\	   ^
\	   |
\	.-----.-----.-----.----.----
\	| PWD | NFA | CFA | ...         <--- Word definition
\	.-----.-----.-----.----.----
\	   ^        ^                ^
\	   |        |--Word Body...  |
\	   |
\	.-----.-----.-----.----.----
\	| PWD | NFA | CFA | ...
\	.-----.-----.-----.----.----
\	^                 ^
\	|---Word Header---|
\
\
\
\ *PWD* is the Previous Word pointer, *NFA* is the Name Field Address, and
\ the *CFA* is the first code word in the Forth word. In other Forths this
\ is a special field, but as this is a [Subroutine Threaded][] forth,
\ designed to execute on a Forth machine, this field does not need to do
\ anything. It is simply the first bit of code that gets executed in a Forth
\ definition, and things point to the *CFA*. The rest of the word definition
\ follows and includes the *CFA*. The *NFA* is a variable length field
\ containing the name of the Forth word, it is stored as a counted string,
\ which is what *pack$* was defined for.
\
\ The *NFA* field is not just a simple counted string, the maximum length
\ of a word string is 31 characters, this means that the top three bits are
\ available for use for other purposes. The top bit is used as the hidden
\ word field, if set the word will not be found when searching through the
\ dictionary. The next bit after the topmost bit is the 'immediate' bit, if
\ set then the word is an *immediate* word, the bit after that is for whether
\ a word is *compile-only*, if set then the word should only be used compiled
\ into a word and never at run time. Previously the two top most bits in the
\ *PWD* field were used for the *immediate* and *compile-only* bits, as those
\ bits in the address field were unused, which complicated iterating through
\ the dictionaries linked list. In the current scheme, word access is
\ complicated, but this is largely hidden behind standard words.
\
\ As an aside, We do not need a 'hidden' bit, we could just set the length to
\ zero however we would not be able to un-hide words. Zero length word
\ definitions are not allowed, so this would work.
\
\ Another property of a word is whether it is an inline word or not, which is
\ a property of the location of where the word is defined, and applies to words
\ like *r@* and *r>*, this is done by checking to see  if the word is between
\ two sentinel values.
\
\ Immediate and compiling words are a very important concept in Forth, and it
\ is possible for the programmer to define their own immediate words. The
\ Forth Read-Evaluate loop is quite simple, as this diagram shows:
\

\
\ No matter how complex the Forth system may appear, this loop forms the heart
\ of it: parse a word and execute it or compile it, with numbers handled as
\ a special case. Immediate words are always executed, whereas compiling words
\ may be executed depending on whether we are in command mode, or in compile
\ mode, which is stored in the *state* variable. There are several words that
\ affect the interpreter state, such as *:*, *;*, *[*, and *]*.
\
\ We should now talk about some examples of immediate and compiling words,
\ *:* is a compiling word that when executed reads in a single token and
\ creates a new word header with this token. It does not add the new word
\ to the definition just yet. It also does one other things, it switches the
\ interpreter to compile mode, words that are not immediate are instead
\ compiled into the dictionary, as are numbers. This allows us to define
\ new words. However, we need immediate words so that we can break out of
\ compile mode, and enter back into command word so we can actually execute
\ something. *;* is an example of an immediate word, it is executed instead
\ of compiled into the dictionary, it switches the interpreter back into
\ command mode, as well as finishing off the word definition by compiling
\ an exit instructions into the dictionary, and adding the word into the
\ current definitions word list.
\
\ The control structure words, like *if*, *for*, and *begin*, are just words
\ as well, they are immediate words and will be explained later.
\
\ *nfa* and *cfa* both take a pointer to the *PWD* field and adjust it to
\ point to different sections of the word.

h: word.count count fallthrough; ( nfa -- u : get a words length )
h: word.length $1F and ;

xchange _forth-wordlist _system
: nfa cell+ ; ( pwd -- nfa : move to name field address)
: cfa nfa dup c@ word.length + cell+ down ; ( pwd -- cfa )
xchange _system _forth-wordlist

\ *.id* prints out a words name field.

h: .id nfa word.count type space ; ( pwd -- : print out a word )

\ *immediate?*, *compile-only?* and *inline?* are the tests words that
\ all take a pointer to the *PWD* field.

h: immediate? nfa $40 fallthrough; ( pwd -- t : is word immediate? )
h: set? swap @ and 0<> ;           ( a u -- t : it any of 'u' set? )
h: compile-only? nfa $20 set? ;    ( pwd -- t : is word compile only? )
h: inline? inline-start inline-end within ; ( pwd -- t : is word inline? )

\ Now we know the structure of the dictionary we can define some words that
\ work with it. We will define *find* and *search-wordlist*, which will
\ be derived from *(find)* and *(search-wordlist)*. *(search-wordlist)* will
\ attempt to find a word in a specific word list, and *find* will attempt to
\ find a word in all the word lists in the current order.
\
\ *(search-wordlist)* and *(find)* both return as much information about the
\ words they find as possible, if they find them. *(search-wordlist)* returns
\ the *PWD* of the word that points to the found word, the *PWD* of the
\ found word and a number indicating whether the found word is immediate
\ (1) or a compiling word (-1). It returns zero, the original counted string,
\ and another zero if the word could not be found in its first argument, a word
\ list (wid). The word is provided as a counted string in the second argument
\ to *(search-wordlist)*.
\
\ *(find)* wraps up *(search-wordlist)* and applies it to all the words in the
\ search order. It returns the same values as *(search-wordlist)* if a word is
\ found, returns the original counted word string address if it was not found,
\ as well as zeros.
\

h: (search-wordlist) ( a wid -- PWD PWD 1|PWD PWD -1|0 a 0: find word in WID )
  swap >r dup
  begin
    dup
  while
    dup nfa count $9F ( $1F:word-length + $80:hidden ) and r@ count compare 0=
    if ( found! )
      rdrop
      dup immediate? 1 or negate exit
    then
    nip dup@
  repeat
  rdrop 2drop-0 ;

h: (find) ( a -- pwd pwd 1 | pwd pwd -1 | 0 a 0 : find a word dictionary )

  while
    dup@ @ r@ swap (search-wordlist) ?dup
    if
      >r rot-drop r> rdrop exit
    then
    cell+
  repeat drop-0 r> 0x0000 ;

\ *search-wordlist* and *find* are simple applications of *(search-wordlist)*
\ and *(find)* there is a difference between this Forths version of *find* and
\ the standard one, this version of *find* does not return an execution token
\ but a pointer in the word header which can be turned into an execution token
\ with *cfa*.

: search-wordlist (search-wordlist) rot-drop ; ( a wid -- PWD 1|PWD -1|a 0 )
: find ( a -- pwd 1 | pwd -1 | a 0 : find a word in the dictionary )
  (find) rot-drop ;

\
\ ## Numeric Input
\
\ Numeric input is handled next, converting a string into a number, which is
\ similar to numeric output.
\
\ *digit?* takes a character and the current base and returns a character
\ converted to the number it represents in the base and a boolean indicating
\ whether or not the conversion was successful. An ASCII character set is
\ assumed.

h: digit? ( c base -- u f )
  >r [char] 0 - 9 over <
  if
    7 -
    dup $A < or
  then dup r> u< ;

\ *>number* does the work of the numeric conversion, getting a character
\ from an input array, converting the character to a number, multiplying it
\ by the current input base and adding in to the number being converted. It
\ stops on the first non-numeric character.
\
\ *>number* accepts a string as an address-length pair which are the first
\ two arguments, and a starting number for the number conversion (which is
\ usually zero). *>number* returns a string containing the unconverted
\ characters, if any, as well as the converted number.
\
\ *>number* operates on unsigned double cell values, not single cell values.
\

: >number ( ud b u -- ud b u : convert string to number )
  begin
    ( get next character )
    2dup 2>r drop c@ base@ digit?
    0= if                                 ( d char )
      drop                                ( d char -- d )
      2r>                                 ( restore string )
      nop exit                            ( ..exit )
    then                                  ( d char )
    swap base@ um* drop rot base@ um* d+  ( accumulate digit )
    2r>                                   ( restore string )
    +string dup0=                         ( advance string and test for end )
  until ;

\ *>number* is a generic word, but awkward to use,  *number?* does some
\ processing of the results to *>number* and handles other input processing
\ expected for numbers. For example numbers can be prefixed by *$* to specify
\ they are in hex, regardless of the current base. The
\ decimal point is handled for double cell input. The minus sign, *-*, can
\ be used as a prefix for any base specifier to indicate the number is negative
\ The negative prefix must come before any base specifier. *dpl* is used to
\ store where the decimal place occurred in the input.
\
\ A more Forth like of handling numbers of a different base would be to have
\ a word defined called *$*, which would attempt to parse the next number in
\ the input stream as a number with a modified *base* variable. This would
\ simplify the definition of 'number?'.
\

h: number? ( a u -- d -1 | a u 0 )
  [-1] dpl !
  base@ >r
  string@ [char] - = dup>r if     +string then
  string@ [char] $ =       if hex +string then
  2>r 0 dup 2r>
  begin
    >number dup
  while string@ [char] .  ( fsp @ ) xor
    if rot-drop rot r> 2drop-0 r> base! exit then
    1- dpl ! 1+ dpl @
  repeat 2drop r> if dnegate then r> base! [-1] ;

\
\ ## Parsing
\
\ After a line of text has been fetched the line needs to be tokenized into
\ space delimited words, which is as complex as parsing gets in Forth.
\ Technically Forth has no fixed grammar as any Forth word is free to parse
\ the following input stream however it likes, but it is rare that to deviate
\ from the norm and words which do complex processing are highly discouraged.

\
\ ## The Interpreter
\
\ The interpreter consists of two main words, *literal* and *interpret*. Other
\ useful words are also defined, such as *,* or *immediate*, but they are
\ relatively trivial in comparison.
\
\ *interpret* takes a pointer to a counted string and interprets the
\ results, with this word we have the main interpreter. It searches for
\ words, executes them or compiles them if found, or if it is not a word
\ it attempts to convert it to a number, if this fails an error is signaled.
\
\ *interpret* also handles single cell and double cell conversion and
\ compilation. It does not know what to do with numbers directly, instead
\ it executes the execution token stored in *<literal>*, which contains
\ *(literal)*. *(literal)* has two different behaviors depending on the
\ execution state, in compiling mode the number is compiled into the
\ dictionary with *literal*.
\
\ *literal* takes a number and compiles a number literal into the dictionary
\ which when run will push the number provided to it. Numbers below $7FFF
\ can be compiled to a single instruction, numbers between $FFFF and $8000
\ are compiled as the bitwise inversion of the number followed by and invert
\ instruction. Single cell values take between 1-2 instructions to represent
\ and double cell values between 2 and 4 instructions.
\
\ As said, the other words a pretty straight forward and behave the same
\ as you would expect in most other Forths, *,* writes a value in the
\ next available location in the dictionary, *c,* does the same but for
\ character sized values (potentially making the dictionary unaligned). They
\ both check there is enough room left in the dictionary to proceed.
\
\ *compile,* is needed as this is a subroutine threaded Forth, execution
\ tokens should be handed to *compile,* and not straight to *,* which would
\ be ideal. This is because addresses need to be converted into a call
\ instruction before they are written into the dictionary. On other Forths
\ you might get away with using *,*.
\
\ *immediate*, *compile-only* and *smudge* work by setting bits in the
\ word header. *immediate* and *compile-only* should be familiar by now, they
\ set bits in the *NFA* field of a words header. *smudge* works by toggling
\ a bit in the name fields length byte, which by virtue of how searching
\ works means that the word will not be found in the dictionary any more.
\ *smudge* is *not* used to hide the word being currently defined until the
\ matching *;* is met, however that is it's most common use in other Forths
\ if it is defined. It hides the latest define word.

\
\ ## Strings
\
\ The string word set is quite small, there are words already defined for
\ manipulating strings such *c@*, and *count*, but they are not exclusively
\ used for strings. These woulds will allow string literals to be embedded
\ within word definitions.
\
\ Forth uses counted strings, at least traditionally, which contain the string
\ length as the first byte of the string. This limits the string length to
\ 255 characters, which is enough for our small Forth but is quite limiting.
\
\ More modern Forths either use NUL terminated strings, or larger counts
\ for their counted strings. Both methods have trade-offs.

\ NUL terminated strings allow for arbitrary lengths, and are often used by
\ programs written in C, or built upon the C runtime, along with their
\ libraries. NUL terminated strings cannot hold binary data however, and have
\ an overhead for string length related operations.
\
\ Using a larger count prefix obviously allows for larger strings, but it
\ is not standard and new words would have to be written, or new conventions
\ followed, when dealing with these strings. For example the *count* word can
\ be used on the entire string if the string size is a single byte in size.
\ Another complication is how big should the length prefix be? 16, 32, or
\ 64-bit? This might depend on the intended use, the preferences of the
\ programmer, or what is most natural on the platform.
\
\ Another complication in modern string handling is [UTF-8][], and other
\ character encoding schemes, which is something to be aware of, but not a
\ subject we will go in to.
\
\ The issues described only talk about problems with Forths representation
\ of strings, nothing has even been said about the difficulty of using them
\ for string heavy applications!
\
\ Only a few string specific words will be defined, for compiling string
\ literals into a word definition, and for returning an address to a compiled
\ string. There are two things the string words will have to do; parse a
\ string from the input stream and compile the string and an action into
\ the dictionary. The action will be more complicated than it might seem as
\ the string literal will be compiled into a word definition, like code is, so
\ the action will have also manipulate the return stack so the string literal
\ is jumped over.

\
\ ## Evaluator
\
\ With the following few words extra words we will have a working Forth
\ interpreter, capable of reading in a line of text and executing it. More
\ words will need to be defined to make the system usable, as well as some
\ house keeping.
\
\ *quit* is the name for the word which implements the interpreter loop,
\ which is an odd name for its function, but this is what it is traditionally
\ called. *quit* calls a few minor functions:
\
\ - *<ok>*, which is the execution vector for the Forth prompt, its contents
\ are executed by *eval*.
\ - *(ok)* defines the default prompt, it only prints *ok* if we are in
\ command mode.
\ - *[* and *]* for changing the interpreter state to command and compile mode
\ respectively. Note that *[* must be an immediate word.
\ - *preset* which resets the input line variables
\ - *?error* handles an error condition from *throw*, it forms the error
\ handling part of the error handler of last resort. It prints out the
\ non-zero error number that occurred and attempts to return the interpreter
\ into a sensible state.
\ - *?depth* checks for a stack underflow
\ - *eval* tokenizes the current input line which *quit* has fetched and
\ calls *interpret* on each token until there is no more. Any errors that
\ occur within *interpreter* or *eval* will be caught by *quit*.
\
\ *quit* will be called from the boot word later on.
\
\ ### I/O Control
\
\ The I/O control section is a relic from eForth that is not really needed
\ in a hosted Forth, at least one where the terminal emulator used handles
\ things like line editing. It is left in here so it can be quickly be added
\ back in if this Forth were to be ported to an embed environment, one in
\ which communications with the Forth took place over a UART.
\
\ Open and reading from different files is also not needed, it is handled
\ by the virtual machine.

\ *quit* can now be defined, it sets up the input line variables, sets the
\ interpreter into command mode, enters an infinite loop it does not exit

\ processes any errors that occur, if any.

( : @echo source type cr ; ( -- : can be used to monitor input )

\ *evaluate* is used to evaluate a string of text as if it were typed in by
\ the programmer. It takes an address and its length, this is used in the
\ word *load*. It needs two new words apart from *eval*, which are *get-input*
\ and *set-input*, these two words are used to retrieve and set the input
\ input stream, which *evaluate* needs to manipulate. *evaluate* saves the
\ current input stream specification and changes it to the new string,
\ restoring to what it was before the evaluation took place. It is careful
\ to catch errors and always perform the restore, any errors that thrown are
\ re-thrown after the input is restored.

\ ## Control Structures and Defining words
\
\
\	Companions the creator seeks, not corpses, not herds and believers.
\	Fellow creators the creator seeks -- those who write new values on
\	new tablets.
\	Companions the creator seeks, and fellow harvesters; for everything
\	about him is ripe for the harvest.
\	- Friedrich Nietzsche
\
\ The next set of words defines relating to control structures and defining
\ new words, along with some basic error checking for the control structures
\ (which is known as 'compiler security' in the Forth community). Some of the
\ words defined here are quite complex, even if their definitions are only
\ a few lines long.
\
\ Control structure words include *if*, *else*, *then*, *begin*, *again*,
\ *until*, *for*, *next*, *recurse* and *tail*. These words are all immediate
\ words and are also compile only, most words visible in the target dictionary
\ in this section have these properties.
\
\ New control structure words can be defined by the user quite easily, for
\ example a word called *unless* can be made which executes a clause if the
\ test provided is false, which is the opposite of *if*. This is one of the
\ many unique features of Forth, that the language itself can be extended
\ and customized. This is possible in languages like *lisp*, but not in *C*,
\ to do the same in *C* would require the modification of the *C* compiler and
\ recompilation. In *forth* (and *lisp*) it is a natural part of the language.
\
\ Using our *unless* example:
\
\	: unless ' 0= compile, postpone if ; immediate
\
\ We this newly defined control structure like so:
\
\	: x unless 99 . cr then ;
\	0 x ( prints *99* )
\	1 x ( prints nothing )
\
\ Not only are the control structures defined in this section, but so are
\ several defining words. These Nietzschean words create new values and
\ words in the dictionary. These words include *:*, and *;*, as well as
\ the more complex *create* and *does>*. To define a new word they need to
\ parse the next word in input stream, so they take over from interpreter loop
\ from one token. They then have differing actions on what they do with this
\ token.
\
\ *:* and *;* should need no explanation as to what they do by now, only
\ the *how* needs to be elucidated. *:* parses the next word in the input
\ stream and puts the *state* variable into compile mode, the *interpret*
\ word will pick this state change up when the word after the one just
\ read in. *:* also makes sure the dictionary is aligned before compilation
\ takes place, it prints out a warning if a word is redefined, compiles the
\ word header for the new word and pushes a magic constant value onto the
\ stack which *;* will pull off. Apart from the word header it does no
\ compilation itself, this is left for the interpreter to do. *;* checks
\ for the magic number *:* left on the stack and throws an error if this
\ is not found. It compiles an *exit* instruction into the dictionary as
\ the final instruction for the word being defined and finally puts the
\ interpreter back into command mode - to do this it needs to be an
\ immediate word. These words also need set the last definition variable
\ and *;* links the new word into the dictionary making it visible.
\
\ *create* and *does>* are often used as pairs, *create* can be used alone,
\ but *does>* should only be used on words that have been make with *create*.
\ *create* defines a new word with a default action of pushes the address
\ of the next location available after the current definition, more memory
\ can be allocated after this with *allot*, *create* can therefore be used
\ to make new data structures. However the default behavior is quite simple,
\ it would be more useful if we could change it, or extend it. This is what
\ *does>* allows us to do.

\ ### DOER/MAKE
\
\ *doer* and *make* which are useful for implementing deferred execution and
\ for making words with vectored execution, found in [Thinking Forth][]. They
\ are not needed for the meta-compiler nor for any of the example programs
\ so they are left commented out. They are useful for reference however.
\
\	: doer create =exit last-cfa ! =exit ,  ;
\	: make ( "name1", "name2", -- : make name1 do name2 )
\	 find-cfa find-cfa make-callable
\	 state@
\	 if
\	   postpone literal postpone literal compile ! nop exit
\	 then
\	 swap! ; immediate
\
\ *doer* creates a new word which by default does nothing. *make* is a state
\ aware word that parses two names, a word created with *doer* which is the
\ first name, and then the name of another word which will become the new
\ action that the word does.
\
\ ### do loops
\
\ This Forth does not define the 'do...loop' wordset, but it is possible to
\ add them in if needed:
\
\	h: (do) r@ swap rot >r >r cell+ >r ; compile-only ( hi lo -- index )
\	: do compile (do) 0 , here ; compile-only immediate ( hi lo -- )
\	h: (leave) rdrop rdrop rdrop ; compile-only
\	: leave compile (leave) nop ; compile-only immediate
\	h: (loop)
\	   r> r> 1+ r> 2dupxor if
\	    >r >r @ >r exit
\	   then >r 1- >r cell+ >r ; compile-only
\	h: (unloop) r> rdrop rdrop rdrop >r ; compile-only
\	: unloop compile (unloop) nop ; compile-only immediate
\	h: (?do)
\	  2dupxor if r@ swap rot >r >r cell+ >r exit then 2drop ; compile-only
\	: ?do compile (?do) 0 , here ; compile-only immediate ( hi lo -- )
\	: loop  compile (loop) dup , compile (unloop) cell- here chars ( -- )
\	    swap! ; compile-only immediate
\	h: (+loop)
\	   r> swap r> r> 2dup - >r
\	   2 pick r@ + r@ xor 0< 0=
\	   3 pick r> xor 0< 0= or if
\	    >r + >r @ >r exit
\	   then >r >r drop cell+ >r ; compile-only
\	: +loop ( n -- ) compile (+loop) dup , compile
\	  (unloop) cell- here chars swap! ; compile-only immediate
\	h: (i)  2r> tuck 2>r nop ; compile-only ( -- index )
\	: i  compile (i) nop ; compile-only immediate ( -- index )
\
\ These define the standard *do*-loop words.
\
\ ### Tracing
\
\ The Virtual Machine has options (or has bits reserved in the VM header) for
\ enabling tracing. Tracing output is quite voluminous when the virtual machine
\ does it. It is possible to add tracing functionality to the Forth interpreter
\ at a higher level as well, but sometimes it is useful to have a low level
\ instruction by instruction view. To enable an easy way to trace word
\ execution the word *trace* is defined, this parses a word name and executes
\ it, turning tracing on just before it executed and turning it off when it
\ returns. The VM prints out; the Program Counter, Instruction, Top Of Stack
\ register, Variable and Return Stack Pointers. This does not give a full
\ view of what is going on, but it helps. If more information is needed it
\ is always possible to edit the VM's C source and recompile it.
\

xchange _forth-wordlist _system
h: trace-execute cpu! >r ; ( u xt -- )
: trace ( "name" -- : trace a word )
  find-cfa cpu@ dup>r 1 or ( ' ) trace-execute ( catch ) r> cpu! ( throw ) ;
xchange _system _forth-wordlist

\ Annotated example output of running *trace* on *+* is shown (excluding
\ instruction decoding output):
\
\	2 2 trace +              ( '+' has the address $5c )
\	[  7b9 6147   5c  8  3 ] ( 'trace-execute' executing '>r' )
\	[  7ba 601c    2  9  2 ] ( 'trace-execute' returns to '+' )
\	[   2e 653f    2  8  2 ] ( '+' executing as instruction 653f )
\	[  7c6 628d    4  7  1 ] ( 'r>' in 'trace', Top of Stack = 4 from 2+2 )
\	[  7c7 800c    0  6  2 ] ( push address of VM options )
\	[  7c8 641f    c  6  3 ] ( disable tracing with '!' )
\	 ok                      ( trace complete and turned off )
\
\
\ ## Vocabulary Words
\
\ The vocabulary word set should already be well understood, if the
\ metacompiler has been. The vocabulary word set is how Forth organizes words
\ and controls visibility of words.
\

h: find-empty-cell 0 fallthrough; ( a -- )
h: find-cell >r begin dup@ r@ <> while cell+ repeat rdrop ; ( u a -- a )

\ *get-order* retrieves the current search order by pushing a list of
\ *wid* values onto the stack *n* long which can be modified before being
\ passed to *set-order*.

: get-order ( -- widn ... wid1 n : get the current search order )
  context
  find-empty-cell
  dup cell- swap
  context - chars dup>r 1- s>d if $32 -throw exit then
  for aft dup@ swap cell- then next @ r> ;

\ *xchange* is used to place the next few words into the root vocabulary,
\ it will be set back to the default shortly.

xchange _forth-wordlist root-voc
: forth-wordlist _forth-wordlist ; ( -- wid : push forth vocabulary )
: system _system ;                 ( -- wid : push system vocabulary )
\ : root-wordlist root-voc ;       ( -- wid : push root vocabulary )
\ : editor-wordlist editor-voc ;   ( -- wid : push editor vocabulary )
\ : hidden-wordlist hidden-voc ;   ( -- wid : push hidden words vocabulary )

\ *set-order* does the opposite of *get-order*, it can be used to set
\ the current search order. It has a special case however, when the number
\ of word lists is set to *-1* it loads the minimal word set, which consists
\ of very few words, namely:
\
\      words forth set-order forth-wordlist
\
\ These words can in turn be used to load the default word list, and find out
\ what words are in the current search order. This is useful to create new
\ words which consist of the minimal set of words to do a job, and once that
\ has been achieved go back to the normal Forth environment.
\
\ *set-order* also checks that the number of word lists is not too high, there
\ should not be more than *#vocs* word lists given to *set-order*, and
\ exception is thrown otherwise.
\
\ *set-order* does not set the definitions word list however, that is the
\ word list which new definitions are added to, *definitions* and *set-current*
\ can be used to do this.

( @warning recursion without using recurse is used )
: set-order ( widn ... wid1 n -- : set the current search order )
  dup [-1] = if drop root-voc 1 set-order exit then ( NB. Recursion! )
  dup #vocs > if $31 -throw exit then
  context swap for aft tuck ! cell+ then next zero ;

\ *forth* loads the root vocabulary containing the minimal word set,
\ and also loads the normal *forth* vocabulary.

: forth root-voc forth-wordlist 2 set-order ; ( -- )

\ *words* is used to display all of the words defined in the dictionary in
\ the current search order. *.words* handles a specific word list, and
\ *not-hidden?* looks at an individual words header to check whether a word
\ is to be shown or now, a bit is set in the words name fields counted
\ string byte, in the highest bit of the count byte, if the word is to be
\ hidden or shown.
\
h: not-hidden? nfa c@ $80 and 0= ; ( pwd -- )
h: .words
    begin
      ?dup
    while dup not-hidden? if dup .id then @ repeat cr ;
: words
  get-order begin ?dup while swap dup cr u. colon-space @ .words 1- repeat ;

\ *xchange* is used to place words back into the forth word list again.

xchange root-voc _forth-wordlist

\ The *previous*/*also*/*only* mechanism for Forth word list manipulation
\ are quite awkward, the only one word keeping is *only* which is just
\ a shortcut for '-1 set-order'. The more powerful words *-order* and *+order*
\ are much easier to use.
\
\ Of note is the idiom 'wid -order wid +order' which reorders the search order
\ so *wid* now has a higher priority than the other word lists. This can be
\ done before *definitions* is used to make *wid* the current definitions
\ word list as well.
\
\ Another idiom is:
\
\	only forth definitions
\
\ Which restores the search order to the default and sets the *forth-wordlist*
\ vocabulary as the one which new definitions are added to.
\
\ Anonymous word lists can be created with the *anonymous* word, this is
\ useful to make programs which only a few words exported to another word
\ list, making things less cluttered.
\
\ For example:
\
\	only forth
\	anonymous definitions
\	: x 99 . ;
\	: y 88 . ;
\	: reorder dup -order +order ;
\	forth-wordlist reorder definitions
\	: z x y cr ;
\	only forth definitions
\ 
\ In this example new words *x*, *y* and *reorder* are created and added
\ to an anonymous wordlist, *z* uses words *x* and *y* from this word this
\ and then the words in the anonymous word lists are hidden, but not the
\ newly defined word *z*, that is available in the default Forth word list.

\ *editor* is a word which loads the editor vocabulary, which will be
\ defined later, it requires *+order* to work.
\

\ ## Block Word Set
\
\ The block word set abstracts out how access to mass storage works in just
\ a handful of words. The main word is *block*, with the words *update*,
\ *flush* and the variable *blk* also integral to the working of the block
\ word set. All of the other words can be implemented upon these.
\
\ Block storage is an outdated, but simple, method of accessing
\ mass storage that demands little from the hardware or the system it is
\ implemented under, just that data can be transfered from memory to disk
\ somehow. It has no requirements that there be a file system, which is
\ perfect for embedded devices as well as upon the microcomputers it
\ originated on.
\
\ A 'Forth block' is 1024 byte long buffer which is backed by a mass
\ storage device, which we will refer to as 'disk'. Very compact programs
\ can be written that have their data stored persistently. Source can
\ and data can be stored in blocks and evaluated, which will be described
\ more in the 'Block editor' section of this document.
\
\ The *block* word does most of the work. The way it is usually implemented
\ is as follows:
\
\ 1. A user provides a block number to the *block* word. The block
\ number is checked to make sure it is valid, and an exception is thrown
\ if it is not.
\ 2. If the block if already loaded into a block buffer from disk, the
\ address of the memory it is loaded into is returned.
\ 3. If it was not, then *block* looks for a free block buffer, loads
\ the 1024 byte section off disk into the block buffer and returns an
\ address to that.
\ 4. If there are no free block buffers then it looks for a block buffer
\ that is marked as being dirty with *update* (which marks the previously
\ loaded block as being dirty when called), then transfers that dirty block
\ to disk. Now that there is a free block buffer, it loads the data that
\ the user wants off of disk and returns a pointer to that, as in the
\ previous bullet point. If none of the buffers are marked as dirty then
\ then any one of them could be reused - they have not been marked as being
\ modified so their contents could be retrieved off of disk if needed.
\ 5. Under all cases, before the address of the loaded block has been
\ returned, the variable *blk* is updated to contain the latest loaded
\ block.
\
\ This word does a lot, but is quite simple to use. It implements a simple
\ cache where data is transfered back to disk only if needed, and multiple
\ sections of memory from disk can be loaded into memory at the same time.
\ The mechanism by which this happens is entirely hidden from the user.
\
\ This Forth implements *block* in a slightly different way. The entire
\ virtual machine image is loaded at start up, and can be saved back to
\ disk (or small sections of it) with the *(save)* instruction. *update*
\ marks the entire image as needing to be saved back to disk, whilst
\ *flush* calls *(save)*. *block* then only has to check the block number
\ is within range, and return a pointer to the block number multiplied by
\ the size of a block - so this means that this version of *block* is just
\ an index into main memory. This is similar to how [colorForth][] implements
\ its block word.
\
: update [-1] block-dirty ! ; ( -- )
h: blk-@ blk @ ;              ( -- k : retrieve current loaded block )
h: +block blk-@ + ;           ( -- )
: save 0 here h: -save (save) throw ;;  ( -- : save blocks )
: flush block-dirty @ 0= ?exit 0 [-1] -save ; ( -- )

: block ( k -- a )
  1depth
  dup $3F u> if $23 -throw exit then
  dup blk !
  $A lshift ( <-- b/buf * ) ;

( : dblock if $23 -throw exit then block ; ( ud -- )

\ The block word set has the following additional words, which augment the
\ set nicely, they are *list*, *load* and *thru*. The *list* word is used
\ for displaying the contents of a block, it does this by splitting the
\ block into 16 lines each, 64 characters long. *load* evaluates a given
\ block, and *thru* evaluates a range of blocks.
\
\ This is how source code was stored and evaluated during the microcomputer
\ era, as opposed to storing the source in named byte stream oriented files
\ as is common nowadays.
\
\ It is more difficult, but possible, to store and edit source code in this
\ manner, but it requires that the programmer(s) follow certain conventions
\ when editing blocks, both in how programs are split up, and how they are
\ formatted.
\
\ A block shown with *list* might look like the following:
\

\ 	   ----------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Longer comments for a source code block were stored in a 'shadow block',
\ which is only enforced by convention. One possible convention is to store
\ the source in even numbered blocks, and the comments in the odd numbered
\ blocks.
\
\ By storing a comment in the first line of a block a word called *index*
\ could be used to make a table of contents all of the blocks available on
\ disk, *index* simply displays the first line of each block within a block
\ range.

\ The common theme is that convention is key to successfully using blocks.
\
\ An example of using blocks to store data is how some old Forths used to
\ store their error messages. Instead of storing strings of error messages
\ in memory (either in RAM or ROM) they were stored in block storage, with
\ one error message per line. The error messages were stored in order, and
\ a word *message* is used to convert an error code like *-4* to its error
\ string (the numbers and what they mean are standardized, there is a table
\ in the appendix), which was then printed out. The full list of the
\ standardized error messages can be stored in four blocks, and form a neat
\ and easy to use database.

\
\ ## Booting
\
\ We are now nearing the end of this tutorial, after the boot sequence
\ word set has been completed we will have a working Forth system. The
\ boot sequence consists of getting the Forth system into a known working
\ state, checking for corruption in the image, and printing out a welcome
\ message. This behaviour can be changed if needed.
\
\ The boot sequence is as follows:
\
\ 1. The virtual machine starts execution at address 0 which will be set
\ to point to the word *boot-loader*
\ 2. The word *boot-loader* is executed, which will execute the execution
\ vector *<cold>*, which is a forward reference to *cold*.
\ 3. The word *cold* checks that the image length and CRC in the image header
\ match the values it calculates, zeros blocks of memory, and initializes the
\ systems I/O.
\ 4. *cold* continues execution by executing the execution token
\ stored in the variable *<boot>*. This is set to *normal-running* by default.
\ 5. *normal-running* prints out the welcome message by calling the word *hi*,
\ and then entering the Forth Read-Evaluate Loop, known as *quit*. This should
\ not normally return.
\
\ The boot sequence is modifiable by the user by either writing an execution
\ token to the *<boot>* variable, or by writing to a jump to a word into memory
\ location zero, if the image is saved, the next time it is run execution will
\ take place at the new location.
\
\ It should be noted that the self-check routine, *bist*, disables checking
\ in generated images by manipulating the word header once the check has
\ succeeded. This is because after the system boots up the image is going
\ to change in RAM soon after *cold* has finished, this could be organized
\ better so only sections of memory that do not (or should not change) get
\ checked, one way this could be achieved is by locating all variables
\ in specific sections, and checking only code. This has the advantage that
\ the system image could be stored in Read Only Memory (ROM), which would
\ facilitate porting the system to low memory systems, such as a
\ microcontroller as they only have a few kilobytes of RAM to work with. The
\ virtual machine primitives for load and store could be changed so that
\ reads get mapped to RAM or ROM based on their address, and writes to RAM
\ also (with attempted writes to ROM throwing an exception). The image is
\ only 6KiB in size, and only a few kilobytes are needed in RAM for a working
\ forth image, perhaps as little as ~2-4 KiB.
\
\ A few other interesting things could be done during the execution of *cold*,
\ the image could be compressed by the metacompiler and the boot sequence
\ could decompress it (which would require the decompressor to be one of the
\ first things to run). Experimenting with various schemes it appears
\ [Adaptive Huffman][] Coding produces the best results, followed by
\ [lzss.c][]). The schemes are also simple and small enough
\ (both in size and memory requirements) that they could be implemented
\ in Forth.
\
\ Another possibility is to obfuscate the image by exclusive or'ing it with
\ a value to frustrate the reserve engineering of binaries, or even to
\ encrypt it and ask for the decryption key on startup.
\
\ Obfuscation and compression are more difficult to implement than a simple
\ CRC check and require a more careful organization and control of the
\ boot sequence than is provided. It is possible to make *turn-key*
\ applications that start execution at an arbitrary point (call *turn-key*
\ because all the user has to do is 'turn the key' and the program is ready
\ to go) by setting the boot variable to the desired word and saving the
\ image with *save*.
\

h: check-header?   header-options @ first-bit 0= ; ( -- t )
h: disable-check 1 header-options toggle ;         ( -- )

\ *bist* checks the length field in the header matches *here* and that the
\ CRC in the header matches the CRC it calculates in the image, it has to
\ zero the CRC field out first.

h: bist ( -- u : built in self test )
  check-header? if 0x0000 exit then       ( is checking disabled? Success? )
  header-length @ here xor if 2 exit then ( length check )
  header-crc @ header-crc zero            ( retrieve and zero CRC )
  0 here crc xor if 3 exit then           ( check CRC )
  disable-check 0x0000 ;                  ( disable check, success )

\ *cold* performs the self check, and exits if it fails. It then
\ goes on to zero memory, set the initial value of *blk*, set the I/O
\ vectors to sensible values, set the vocabularies to the default search
\ order and reset the variable stack.

h: cold ( -- : performs a cold boot  )
   bist ?dup if negate dup yield!? exit then
\  $10 retrieve z
\  $10 block b/buf 0 fill
   $12 retrieve io!
   forth
   empty
   rp0 rp!
   <boot> @execute ;

\ *hi* prints out the welcome message, the version number, sets the numeric
\ base to decimal, and prints out the amount of memory used and free.
\
\ *normal-running* is the boot word, that is *<boot>* is set to.

\ ## See : The Forth Disassembler
\
\ This section defines *see*, the Forth disassembler. This is meant only
\ as a rough debugging tool and not meant to reproduce the exact source. The
\ output format is not defined in any standard, it is just meant to be useful
\ for debugging purposes and perhaps for programmers to quickly determine how
\ a word works.
\
\ There are many ways *see* could be improved but each minor improvement
\ would make the disassembler more complicated and prone to breaking, the
\ disassembler as it stands is probably the best trade-off in terms of
\ complexity and utility. Despite it being small it is still quite useful and
\ does a lot, for example it attempts to look up words in the current word
\ search orders, it prints out the type of instruction, the addresses of
\ instructions and the raw instruction. It also gives information about if
\ a word is compile only or immediate.
\
\ One of the most difficult thing is determining the end of a word,
\ the disassembler uses a crude method by disassembling everything from the
\ start of the word definition in the dictionary to the start of the next
\ one in the same word list - this means that *:noname* definitions (of which
\ the metacompiler makes many in the target) and words not in the same word
\ list that are between the word to be disassembled and the next word in the
\ same word as the word being disassembled will be disassembled in their
\ entirety, their headers and all. As such the output should be viewed only
\ as an aid and as not being definitive and absolutely correct.
\
\ Three words will be defined that do most of the complex work of the
\ disassembler, they are *validate*, *search-for-cfa* and *name*, which
\ should be understood together. To make a disassembler we will need a way
\ to look up compiled calls to words and retrieve their name, this is what
\ *name* does.
\
\ *search-for-cfa* searches a given word list for a CFA (or a Code Field
\ Address, the address of the executable section of a Forth word), it does
\ this by following the dictionary linked list assuming that if a CFA points
\ in between the current word and the previous word in the list then this is
\ word that we are looking for. It uses *validate* to attempt to check this,
\ if we have found a candidate word address by calling the word *cfa* on it,
\ it should move to the same address we provided.

\ *see* is the Forth disassembler, it takes a word and (attempts) to
\ turn it back into readable Forth source code. The disassembler is only
\ a few hundred bytes in size, which is a testament to the brevity achievable
\ with Forth.
\
\ If the word *see* was good enough we could potentially dispense with the
\ source code entirely: the entire dictionary could be disassembled and saved
\ to disk, modified, then recompiled yielding a modified Forth. Although
\ comments would not be present, meaning this would be more of an intellectual
\ exercise than of any utility.
\
\ One way of improving the output would be to move the assembler in the
\ metacompiler to the target image, the same assembler words like *d-1* and
\ *#t|n* could then be used to disassemble ALU instructions, which are
\ currently only displayed in their raw format.

  dup inline?       if ."  inline"       then
      immediate?    if ."  immediate"    then cr ;

\ A few useful utility words will be added next, which are not strictly
\ necessary but are useful. Those are *.s* for examining the contents of the
\ variable stack, and *dump* for showing the contents of a section of memory
\
\ The *.s* word must be careful not to alter that variable stack whilst
\ trying to print it out. It uses the word *pick* to achieve this, otherwise
\ there is nothing special about this word, and it is very useful for
\ debugging code interactively to see what its stack effects are.
\
\ The dump keyword is fairly useful for the implementer so that they can
\ use Forth to debug if the compilation is working, or if a new word
\ is producing the correct assembly. It can also be used as a utility to
\ export binary sections of memory as text.
\
\ The programmer might want to edit the *dump* word to customize its output,
\ the addition of the *dc+* word is one way it could be extended, which is
\ commented out below. Like *dm+*, *dc+* operates on a single line to
\ be displayed, however *dc+* decompiles the memory into human readable
\ instructions instead of numbers, unfortunately the lines it produces are
\ too long.
\
\ Normally the word *dump* outputs the memory contents in hexadecimal,
\ however a design decision was taken to output the contents of memory in
\ what the current numeric output base is instead. This makes the word
\ more flexible, more consistent and shorter, than it otherwise would be as
\ the current output base would have to be saved and then restored.

\
\ ## Block Editor
\
\ This block editor is an excellent example of a Forth application; it is
\ small, terse, and uses the facilities already built into Forth to do all
\ of the heavy lifting, specifically vocabularies, the block word set and
\ the text interpreter.
\
\ Forth blocks used to be the canonical way of storing both source code and
\ data within a Forth system, it is a simply way of abstracting out how mass
\ storage works and worked well on the microcomputers available in the 1980s.
\ With the rise of computers with a more capable operating systems the Block
\ [Block Word Set][] Word Set fell out of favor, being replaced instead by
\ the [File Access Word Set][], allowing named files to be accessed as a
\ byte stream.
\
\ To keep things simple this editor uses the block word set and in typical
\ Forth fashion simplifies the problem to the extreme, whilst also sacrificing
\ usability and functionally - the block editor allows for the editing of
\ programs but it is more difficult and more limited than traditional editors.
\ It has no spell checking, or syntax highlighting, and does little in the
\ way of error checking. But it is very small, compact, easy to understand, and
\ if needed could be extended.
\
\ The way this editor works is by replacing the current search order with
\ a set of words that implement text editing on the currently loaded block,
\ as well as managing what block is loaded. The defined words are short,
\ often just a single letter long.
\
\ The act of editing text is simplified as well, instead of keeping track of
\ variable width lines of text and files, a single block (1024 characters) is
\ divided up into 16 lines, each 64 characters in length. This is the essence
\ of Forth, radically simplifying the problem from all possible angels; the
\ algorithms used, the software itself and where possible the hardware. Not
\ every task can be approached this way, nor would everyone be happy with
\ the results, the editor being presented more as a curiosity than anything
\ else.
\
\ We have a way of loading and saving data from disks (the *block*, *update*
\ and *flush* words) as well as a way of viewing the data  in a block (the
\ *list* word) and evaluating the text within a block (with the *load* word).
\ The variable *blk* is also of use as it holds the latest block we have
\ retrieved from disk. By defining a new word set we can skip the part of
\ reading in a parsing commands and numbers, we can use text interpreter and
\ line oriented input to do the work for us, as discussed.
\
\ Only one extra word is actually need given the words we already have, one
\ which can destructively replace a line starting at a given column in the
\ currently loaded block. All of the other commands are simple derivations
\ of existing words. This word is called *ia*, short for 'insert at', which
\ takes two numeric arguments (starting line as the first, and column as the
\ second) and reads all text on the line after the *ia* and places it at the
\ specified line/column.
\
\ The command description and their definitions are the best descriptions
\ of how this editor works. Try to use the word set interactively to get
\ a feel for it:
\
\	| A1 | A2 | Command |                Description                 |
\	| -- | -- | ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
\	| #2 | #1 |  ia     | insert text into column #1 on line #2      |
\	|    | #1 |  i      | insert text into column  0 on line #1      |
\	|    | #1 |  l      | load block number #1                       |
\	|    | #1 |  k      | blank line number #1                       |
\	|    |    |  z      | blank currently loaded block               |
\	|    |    |  v      | redisplay currently loaded block           |
\	|    |    |  q      | remove editor word set from search order   |
\	|    |    |  n      | load next block                            |
\	|    |    |  p      | load previous block                        |
\	|    |    |  s      | save changes to disk                       |
\	|    |    |  x      | evaluate block                             |
\
\ An example command session might be:
\
\	| Command Sequence         | Description                             |
\	| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |

\	| $20 l v                  | load block $20 (hex) and display it     |
\	| z                        | blank block $20                         |
\	| 0 i .( Hello, World ) cr | Put ".( Hello, World ) cr" on line 0    |

## The Virtual Machine

The Virtual Machine is a 16-bit stack machine based on the [H2 CPU][], itself
a derivative of the [J1 CPU][], but adapted for use on a computer.

Its instruction set allows for a fairly dense encoding, and the project
goal is to be fairly small whilst still being useful.  It is small enough
that is should be easily understandable with little explanation, and it
is hackable and extensible by modification of the source code.

## Virtual Machine Memory Map

There is 64KiB of memory available to the Forth virtual machine, of which only
the first 16KiB can contain program instructions (or more accurately branch
and call locations can only be in the first 16KiB of memory). The virtual
places little restrictions on what goes where, however the eForth image maps
things out in the following way:

	| Block   |  Region          |
	| ------- | ---------------- |
	| 0       | Image header     |
	| 0 - 15  | Program Storage  |
	| 16      | User Data        |
	| 17      | Variable Stack   |
	| 18 - 62 | User data        |
	| 63      | Return Stack     |

The virtual machine uses the first twenty cells for special purposes, apart
from the division between program/data and data only sections this is the
only restriction that the *virtual machine* places on memory.

The first twenty locations are used for:

	| Address  |  Use                                                         |
	| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
	| $0       | Initial Program Counter (PC) value and reset vector          |
	| $2       | Initial Top of Stack Register value                          |
	| $4       | Initial Return Stack Register value (grows downwards)        |
	| $6       | Initial Variable Stack Register value (grows upwards)        |

The eForth image maps things in the following way. The variable stack starts
at the beginning of block 17 and grows upwards, the return stack starts at
the end of block 63 and grows downward. The trap handler is set to a call
a word called *-throw*, defined as ": -throw negate throw ;". The virtual
machine image size is assumed to be the maximum allowable value of "$8000".
The virtual machine memory size is specified in cells, not bytes, "$8000" is
the maximum number of cells that a 16-bit value can address if the lowest bit
is used to specify a byte.

## Instruction Set Encoding

For a detailed look at how the instructions are encoded the source code is the
definitive guide, available in the file [forth.c][], or consult the reference
implementation in the Appendix.

A quick overview:

	+---------------------------------------------------------------+
	| F | E | D | C | B | A | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
	+---------------------------------------------------------------+
	| 1 |                    LITERAL VALUE                          |
	+---------------------------------------------------------------+
	| 0 | 0 | 0 |            BRANCH TARGET ADDRESS                  |
	+---------------------------------------------------------------+
	| 0 | 0 | 1 |            CONDITIONAL BRANCH TARGET ADDRESS      |
	+---------------------------------------------------------------+
	| 0 | 1 | 0 |            CALL TARGET ADDRESS                    |
	+---------------------------------------------------------------+
	| 0 | 1 | 1 |   ALU OPERATION   |T2N|T2R|N2T|R2P| RSTACK| DSTACK|
	+---------------------------------------------------------------+
	| F | E | D | C | B | A | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
	+---------------------------------------------------------------+

	T   : Top of data stack
	N   : Next on data stack
	PC  : Program Counter

	LITERAL VALUES : push a value onto the data stack
	CONDITIONAL    : BRANCHS pop and test the T
	CALLS          : PC+1 onto the return stack

	T2N : Move T to N
	T2R : Move T to top of return stack
	N2T : Move the new value of T (or D) to N
	R2P : Move top of return stack to PC

	RSTACK and DSTACK are signed values (twos compliment) that are
	the stack delta (the amount to increment or decrement the stack
	by for their respective stacks: return and data)

### ALU Operations

The ALU can be programmed to do the following operations on an ALU instruction,
some operations trap on error (UM/MOD, /MOD).

### Encoding of Forth Words

Many Forth words can be encoded directly in the instruction set, some of the
ALU operations have extra stack and register effects as well, which although
would be difficult to achieve in hardware is easy enough to do in software.

## Interaction

The outside world can be interacted with in two ways, with single character
input and output, or by saving the current Forth image. The interaction is
performed by three instructions.

## eForth

The interpreter is based on eForth described by C. H. Ting, and written by
Bill Muench with some modifications to the model.

## eForth Memory model

The eForth model imposes extra semantics to certain areas of memory, along
with the virtual machine.

	| Address       | Block  | Meaning                           |

## ANSI Terminal Escape Sequence Word Set

The following word set implements [ANSI escape codes][].

	variable <page>
	variable <at-xy>

	: page <page> @ execute ;   ( -- : page screen )
	: at-xy <at-xy> @ execute ; ( x y -- : set cursor position )

	: CSI $1b emit [char] [ emit ;
	: 10u. base @ >r decimal 0 <# #s #> type r> base ! ; ( u -- )
	: ansi swap CSI 10u. emit ; ( n c -- )
	: (at-xy) CSI 10u. $3b emit 10u. [char] H emit ; ( x y -- )
	: (page) 2 [char] J ansi 1 1 at-xy ; ( -- )
	: sgr [char] m ansi ; ( -- )

	1 constant red 2 constant green 4 constant blue

	: color $1e + sgr ;

	' (at-xy) <at-xy> !
	' (page)  <page>  !

Usage is quite simple:

	red color sgr  ( set terminal text color to red )
	page           ( clear screen, set cursor to position 1,1 )
	$8 $4 at-xy    ( set cursor to position column 8, row 4 )
	0 sgr          ( reset terminal attributes, color goes back to normal )

		A FAST HIGH-LEVEL FLOATING POINT

	If binary normalization and rounding are used, a fast
	single-precision FORTH floating point can be built with
	accuracy adequate for many applications. The creation
	of such high-level floating points has become of more
	than academic interest with the release of the Novix
	FORTH chip. The FORTH-83 floating point presented here
	is accurate to 4.8 digits. Values may range from about
	9E-4933 to about 5E4931. This floating point may be
	used without fee provided the copyright notice and
	associated information in the source are included.

	FIXED VS. FLOATING POINT

	FORTH programmers have traditionally favored fixed over
	floating point. A fixed point application is harder to
	write. The range of each value must be known and
	considered carefully, if adequate accuracy is to be
	maintained and overflow avoided. But fixed point
	applications are much more compact and often much
	faster than floating point (in the absence of floating
	point hardware).

	The debate of fixed vs. floating point is at least as
	old as the ENIAC, the first electronic digital
	computer. John von Neumann used fixed point on the
	ENIAC. He felt that the detailed understanding of
	expressions required by fixed point was desirable, and
	that fixed point was well worth the extra time (1).

	But computers are no longer the scarce resource that
	they once were, and the extra programming time is often
	more costly than any advantages offered by fixed point.
	For getting the most out of the least hardware,
	however, fixed point will always be the technique of
	choice.

	Fixed point arithmetic represents a real number as a
	ratio of integers, with an implicit divisor. This
	implicit divisor may be thought of as the
	representation of unity. If unity were represented by
	300, for example, 2.5 would be represented by 750.

	To multiply 2.5 by 3.5, with all values representing
	unity as ten, one would evaluate

			     25 * 35
			     -------
			       10

	The ten is called a scale factor, and the division by
	ten is called a scaling operation. This expression is
	obviously inefficient, requiring both a division and a
	multiplication to accomplish a multiplication.

	Most scaling operations can, however, be eliminated by
	a little algebraic manipulation. In the case of the sum
	of two squares, for example, where A and B are fixed
	point integers and unity is represented by the integer
	U,

	      A * A   B * B           (A * A)+(B * B)
	      ----- + -----    -->    ---------------
		U       U                    U

	In addition to the elimination of a division by U, the
	right expression is more accurate. Each division can
	introduce some error, and halving the number of
	divisions halves the worst-case error.

	DECIMAL VS. BINARY NORMALIZATION

	A floating point number consists of two values, an
	exponent and a mantissa. The mantissa may represent
	either an integer or a fraction. The exponent and the
	mantissa are related to each other in the same way as
	the value and power of ten in scientific notation are
	related.

	A mantissa is always kept as large as possible. This
	process is called normalization. The following
	illustrates the action of decimal normalization with an
	unsigned integer mantissa:

		 Value       Stack representation
		       4

		 5 * 10         50000  0  --
		       3
		   * 10          7000  0  --
		       3
		   * 10         50000 -1  --

	The smallest the mantissa can become is 6554. If a
	mantissa of 6553 is encountered, normalization requires
	that it be made 65530, and that the exponent be
	decremented. It follows that the worst-case error in
	representing a real number is half of 1 part in 6554,
	or 1 part in 13108. The error is halved because of the
	rounding of the real number to the nearest floating
	point value.

	Had we been using binary normalization, the smallest
	mantissa would have been 32768, and the worst case
	error in representation would have been 1 part 65536,
	or 1/5 that of decimal normalization. LOG10(65536) is
	4.8, the accuracy in decimal digits.

	As with fixed point, scaling operations are required by
	floating point. With decimal normalization, this takes
	the form of division and multiplication by powers of
	ten. Unlike fixed point, no simple algebraic
	manipulation will partly eliminate the scale factors.
	Consequently there are twice as many multiplications
	and divisions as the floating point operators would
	seem to imply. Due to the presence of scaling in 73% of
	decimally normalized additions (2), the amount is
	actually somewhat over twice.

	With binary normalization, by contrast, this extra
	multiplication effectively disappears. The scaling by
	a power of two can usually be handled with a single
	shift and some stack manipulation, all fast operations.

	Though a decimally normalized floating point can be
	incredibly small (3), a binary normalized floating
	point has 1/5 the error and is about twice as fast.

	It should be mentioned that the mantissa should be
	multiples of 2 bytes if the full speed advantage of
	binary normalization is to be available. Extra shifting
	and masking operations are necessary with odd byte
	counts when using the 2-byte arithmetic of FORTH.

	NUMBER FORMAT AND ARITHMETIC

	This floating point package uses an unsigned single
	precision fraction with binary normalization,
	representing values from 1/2 to just under 1. The high
	bit of the fraction is always set.

	The sign of the floating point number is carried in the
	high bit of the single precision exponent, The
	remaining 15 bits of the exponent represent a power of
	2 in excess 4000 hex. The use of excess 4000 permits
	the calculation of the sign as an automatic outcome of
	exponent arithmetic in multiplication and division.

	A zero floating point value is represented by both a
	zero fraction and a zero exponent. Any operation that
	produces a zero fraction also zeros the exponent.

	The exponent is carried on top of the fraction , so the
	sign may be tested by the phrase DUP 0< and zero by the
	phrase DUP 0= .

	The FORTH-83 Double Number Extension Word Set is
	required. Floating point values are used with the "2"
	words: 2CONSTANT, 2@, 2DUP, etc.

	There is no checking for exponent overflow or underflow
	after arithmetic operation, nor is division by zero
	checked for. The rationale for this is the same as with
	FORTH integer arithmetic. By requiring that the user
	add any such tests, 1) all arithmetic isn't slowed by
	tests that are only sometimes needed and 2) the way in
	which errors are resolved may be determined by the
	user. The extremely large exponent range makes exponent
	overflow and underflow quite unlikely, of course.

	All of the arithmetic is rounding. The failure to round
	is the equivalent of throwing a bit of accuracy away.
	The representational accuracy of 4.8 digits will be
	quickly lost without rounding arithmetic.

	The following words behave like their integer
	namesakes:

	     F+  F-  F*  F/  F2*  F2/  FABS  FNEGATE  F<

	Single precision integers may be floated by FLOAT, and
	produced from floating point by FIX and INT, which are
	rounding and truncating, respectively. DFLOAT floats a
	double precision integer.

	NUMBER INPUT AND OUTPUT

	Both E and F formats are supported. A few illustrations
	should suffice to show their usage. An underscore
	indicates the point at which the return key is pressed.
	PLACE determines the number of places to the right of
	the decimal point for output only.

		   12.34  F      F. _ 12.340
		   12.34  F      E. _ 1.234E1
		   .033 E -1002  E. _ 3.300E-1004

		   4 PLACES

		   2. F -3. F F/ F. _ -0.6667
		   2. F -3. F F/ E. _ -6.6667E-1

	F and E will correctly float any input string
	representing a signed double precision number. There
	may be as many as 9 digits to the right of the decimal
	point. Numbers input by E are accurate to over 4
	digits. F is accurate to the full 4.8 digits if there
	are no digits to the right of the decimal point.
	Conversion is slightly less accurate with zeros to the
	right of the decimal point because a division by a
	power of ten must be added to the input conversion
	process.

	F and E round the input value to the nearest floating
	point value. So a sixth digit will often allow a more
	accurately rounded conversion, even thought the result
	is only accurate to 4.8 digits. There is no advantage
	to including trailing zeros, however. In many floating
	points, this extra accuracy can only be achieved by the
	inconvenient procedure of entering the values as
	hexadecimal integers.

	Only the leftmost 5 digits of the F. output are
	significant. F. displays values from 32767 to -32768,
	with up to 4 additional places to the right of the
	decimal point. The algorithm for F. avoids double
	rounding by using integer rather than floating point
	multiplication to scale by a power of ten. This gives
	as much accuracy as possible at the expense of a
	somewhat limited range. Since a higher limit on size
	would display digits that are not significant, this
	range limit does not seem at all undesirable.

	Like E input, E. is accurate to somewhat over 4 digits.
	The principal source of inaccuracy is the function EXP,
	which calculates powers of 2.

	The following extended fraction is used by EXP. It
	gives the square root of 2 to the x power. The result
	must be squared to get 2 to the x.

			      2x
		 1 + ---------------------------
				      57828
		     34.668 - x - --------------
						2
				  2001.18 + (2x)

	In order to do E format I/O conversion, one must be
	able to evaluate the expressions

		 a   a/log10(2)        b    b*log10(2)
	       10 = 2           and   2 = 10

	These log expressions may be easily evaluated with
	great precision by applying a few fixed point
	techniques. First, a good rational approximation to
	log10(2) is needed.

		    log10(2)     = .3010299957
		    4004 / 13301 = .3010299978

	The following code will convert an integer power of
	ten, assumed to be on the stack, into a power of 2:

		       13301 4004 */MOD >R
		       FLOAT 4004 FLOAT F/ EXP
		       R> +

	The first line divides the power of ten by log10(2) and
	pushes the quotient on the return stack. The quotient
	is the integer part of the power of two.

	The second line finds the fractional part of the power
	of two by dividing the remainder by the divisor. This
	floating point fractional part is evaluated using EXP.

	The third line adds the integer power of two into the
	exponent of the floating point value of the fractional
	part, completing the conversion.

	The inverse process is used to convert a power of 2 to
	a power of ten.

	FORTH-83 LIMITATIONS

	Perhaps the most serious deficiency in the FORTH-83
	with extensibility as its pre-eminent feature, it is
	surprisingly difficult to write standard code that will
	alter the processing of numeric input strings by the
	interpreter and compiler.

	It is usually a simple matter to replace the system
	conversion word (usually called NUMBER) with a routine
	of ones choice. But there if no simple standard way of
	doing this. The interpreter, compiler and abort
	language are all interwoven, and may all have to be
	replaced if a standard solution is sought.

	This floating point package assumes that double
	precision integers are generated if the numeric input
	string contains a period, and that a word PLACES can be
	written that will leave the number of digits to the
	right of the period. This does not seem to be
	guaranteed by FORTH-83, although it may be safely
	assumed on most systems that include double precision.

	If you know how this part of your system works, you
	will probably want to eliminate the words E and F, and
	instead force floating point conversion of any input
	string containing a period. Double precision integers
	could still be generated by using a comma or other
	punctuation.

	It is suggested that future FORTH standards include the
	word NUMBER, which is a vector to the current input
	numeric word.

	It is also suggested that the Double Number Extension
	Wordset specification include a requirement that the
	interpreter and compiler be able to accept input
	strings specifying double precision values.

	COMMENTS ON THE FOLLOWING CODE

	The words ". and "- leave the ASCII values for period
	and minus, respectively. Replace these with whatever
	language you prefer for insertion of ASCII values.

	The size of F+ can be considerably reduced at the
	expense of quite a lot of execution speed. Think twice
	before you simplify it.

	The normalizing word NORM expects the stack value under
	the exponent to be a double precision signed integer.
	It leaves a normalized floating point number, rounding
	the double precision integer into the fraction.

	ALIGN and RALIGN expect an integer shift count with an
	unsigned double precision number beneath. They leave
	double precision unsigned integer results. At least one
	shift is always performed. RALIGN rounds after
	alignment.

	UM/ divides an unsigned double precision number by an
	unsigned single precision number, and rounds the single
	precision quotient.

	ZERO forces a floating point value with a zero fraction
	to also have a zero exponent.

	FSIGN applies the sign of the stack value under the
	exponent to the exponent. The double precision integer
	under an exponent is left unsigned.

	FEXP evaluates a power of e. It is included because it
	is a trivial but useful application of EXP.

	GET converts the next word in the input stream into a
	single precision signed integer.

## LOCATE facility

Some Forths provide a word called *locate* which allows you to look up where
a word defined in source. This one looks through a given block to find a space
delimited word, and if found it returns a boolean indicating whether it found
it and on which line number it found it. It could easily be adapted to search
through a list of blocks (which would be more useful). *locate* is an example
of using block storage as a primitive database, it could be used for other
purposes as well, for example finding users or looking up values in a list of
things.


	$40 constant c/l
	$10 constant l/b

	: =string compare 0= ;
	: line c/l * blk @ block + c/l ;                     ( u -- a u )
	: locate-line                                        ( a -- f )
	    begin
	       bl word dup c@
	    while
	      over count rot count
	      =string if drop -1 exit then
	    repeat 2drop 0 ;

	: redirect ( a u -- )
	  get-input >r >r >r >r >r
	  line 0 -1 0 set-input
	  ' locate-line catch
	  r> r> r> r> r> set-input throw ;

	: (locate) ( a --, locate counted string 'a' current in 'blk' )
	    0 l/b 1- for
	      2dup redirect if nip -1 rdrop exit then
	    1+ next 2drop 0 ; ( k -- )

	: locate ( "name", k -- u t )
	    block drop bl word count pad pack$ (locate) ;

	: found ." FOUND BLK:" blk @ u. ."  LINE:" dup u. cr line type cr ; ( u -- )
	: not-found drop ." NOT FOUND" cr ; ( u --  )
	: .locate locate if found exit then not-found ; ( "name", k -- )

	hide line
	hide redirect
	hide (locate)
	hide locate-line
	hide found
	hide not-found

	editor $18 l z
	0 i  HELLO ...
	1 i    
	2 i 
	3 i   ... WORLD HOW ARE YOU
	4 i     X      Y
	v
	q

	$18 .locate WORLD ( <- found, line 3 )
	$18 .locate YOU   ( <- found, line 3 )
	$18 .locate $$$   ( <- not-found )
	$18 .locate HELLO ( <- found, line 0 )
	$18 .locate Y     ( <- found, line 4 )

The way this word set works is similar to how the *load* word works, it
redirects the parser to parse out space delimited words line by line from a
block, but instead of evaluating the line it does a string comparison on each
space delimited word. We could simplify this if the *eval* keyword was
vectored, or even better if *interpret* was. For that matter, it would help
if a number of input words were vectored.
